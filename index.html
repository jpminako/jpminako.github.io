# DOCUMENT ONE - Employment Law Fundamentals for HR Professionals

Objective
1.	The objective of this course is to assist employers in identifying the relevant employment laws that they must comply with and in particular, their legal obligations to provide minimum entitlements to employees.
This course is intended to provide a broad overview of the employment laws that employers must follow. It has not been designed to cover every element of the laws in detail. CCIWA recommends that participants attend further specific training courses on areas of individual interest or seek further advice from CCIWA employee relations advisers on matters as they arise.

1.	The Fair Work legislation
The Fair Work Act 2009 (the FW Act) is the key piece of industrial relations legislation applying in Australia. In addition to the FW Act, there are a number of key laws and regulations that govern the national workplace relations system. These include:
Fair Work Regulations 2009
The Fair Work Regulations 2009 were created to supplement the FW Act.
Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2009
The Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2009 makes transitional provisions to move employers, employees and organisations from the old Workplace Relations Act 1996 to the new system.
Fair Work (State Referral and Consequential and Other Amendments) Act 2009
The Fair Work (State Referral and Consequential and Other Amendments) Act 2009 amends the FW Act to enable States to refer matters to the Commonwealth to establish a national workplace relations system.
Fair Work Amendment (State Referrals and Other Measures) Act 2009
The Fair Work (State Referrals and Other Measures) Act 2009 amends the FW Act to give effect to state government referrals of certain workplace relations matters to the Commonwealth and allows state governments to retain workplace relations powers in relation to state public sector employees and local government employees if they choose to do so.
The two main bodies involved are the Fair Work Commission and the Fair Work Ombudsman:
The Fair Work Commission [www.fwc.gov.au] is the national workplace relations tribunal. It is an independent body with power to carry out a range of functions relating to:
•	the safety net of minimum wages and employment conditions
•	enterprise bargaining
•	industrial action
•	dispute resolution
•	termination of employment
other workplace matters.
ChamberOICommerce
andlnduslJ'yWA
 
The Fair Work Ombudsman [www.fairwork.gov.au] is a statutory body whose role is to give advice and to educate employees, employers, contractors and the community and to promote harmonious, productive and cooperative workplaces. They investigate workplace complaints and enforce compliance with the workplace laws.
The Fair Work Act 2009- Overview
•	Chapter 1 is the Introduction to the Act and contains important definitions and coverage provisions;
•	Chapter 2 provides for Terms and Conditions of employment, including the National Employment Standards, Modern Awards and agreement making;
•	Chapter 3 sets out Rights and Responsibilities of employees, employers and organisations (e.g. Unions) in relation to that employment, including protection from unfair dismissal and adverse action;
•	Chapter 4 provides for Compliance and Enforcement of, the Act;
•	Chapter 5 provides for the Administration of the Act by establishing the Fair Work Commission and the Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman;
•	Chapter 6 deals with Miscellaneous matters relating to the above.

2.	Applicationof the Act
The Fair Work Act 2009 (FW Act) applies to any 'national system employer'. 'National system employer' refers to a constitutional corporation and an employer 'referred' under federal industrial relations coverage by state legislation.

Chamb rofCommme
andlndustryWA
 
The FW Act contains elements which specifically apply only to National System Employers, as well as other elements which apply to both National System and State System Employers.
In all States and Territories, except Western Australia, the FW Act covers all private sector employers and their employees.  In Western Australia, those employers who are not constitutional corporations, such as sole traders and partnerships, remain covered by the state industrial rela.tions system and only limited sections of the FW Act will apply.
3.	Administration of the FW Act
•	I
Fair Work Commission of the Act
l	The Fair Work Commission (FWC) is the national workplace relations tribunal under the FW Act.
The FW Act provides that FWC must perform its functions in a way which is:
e	fair and just
•	quick, informal and avoids unnecessary technicalities
•	open and transparent
•	promotes harmonious and co-operative workplace relations.
FWC may inform itself any way it considers appropriate and is not bound by the rules of evidence. It may hold conferences (usually in private) or hearings (usually in public) and may deal with disputes by mediation or conciliation, by making recommendations, but may only arbitrate in circumstances expressly authorised by the Act.
FWC comprises of a president, deputy presidents, commissioners and at least 4 "minimum wage panel members", as well as a general manager and staff. The "minimum wage panel members" have 5-year terms of office.
1	Fair Work Ombudsman
The FWO is separately constituted and performs a range of functions including promotion of harmonious and co-operative workplace relations and compliance. The FWO is able to represent employees before FWC or a court, including a state court where it has capacity under the FW Act if the FWO considers representing the employees will promote compliance with the FW Act or a "fair work instrument".

1.	What is the NES?
The National Employment Standards (NES) are the statutory minimum entitlements set out in Part 2-2 of the FW Act that apply to all national system employees from 1 January 2010. A further ten (10) minimum standards can be contained in modern awards. The ten (10) award minimum standards together with the eleven (11) NES form the safety net applying to most employees.
The NES apply irrespective of whether an employee is covered by an award or agreement or if an employee earns over the High-Income Threshold.
The minimum standards relate to the following matters:

 
Division 3:
Division 4: Division 4A: Division 5:
Division 6:
Division 7:Division 8:

Personal/carer's leave, compassionate leave and paid family and

Notice of termination and redundancy pay Fair Work Information Statement Miscellaneous
 
Section 55 of the FW Act makes it clear that a modern award or enterprise agreement must not exclude the NES.
A modern award or enterprise agreement may include terms that are ancillary or incidental to the operation of the NES or terms that supplement the NES. However, such terms can only be included to the extent that the effect of those terms is not detrimental to an employee in any respect, when compared against the NES.
Agreements made before the FW Act, which are still in operation as at 1 January 2010, must comply with the NES. Such agreements are referred to in the legislation as transitional instruments. The no-detriment rule contained in the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2009, introduces the requirement that no term of a transitional instrument wiil have effect if it is detrimental to an employee in any respect when compared against an entitlement of that employee under the NES.

2.	NES: Maximum Weekly Hours of Work
An employee's hours of work must not exceed 38 hours for a full-time employee. For part-time employees, hours must not exceed the lesser of 38 hours and the employee's ordinary hours of work in a week. Ordinary hours are determined by the applicable award, agreement or contract of employment. For example, the maximum hours for a part time employee who has a contract of employment which states that their ordinary hours are 25 hours per week, will be 25 hours.
An employer may request that employees work reasonable additional hours. However, an employee may refuse to work additional hours if they are unreasonable. In determining whether additional hours are reasonable the following must be considered:
•	any risk to employee health and safety from working the additional hours;
•	the employee's personal circumstances, including family responsibilities;
•	the needs of the workplace or enterprise in which the employee is employed;
•	whether the employee is entitled to receive overtime payments, penalty rates or other compensation for, or a level of remuneration that reflects an expectation of, working additional hours;
•	any notice given by the employer of any request or requirement to work the additional hours;
•	any notice given by the employee of his or her intention to refuse to work the additional hours;
•	the usual patterns of work in the industry, or the part of an industry, in which the employee works;
•	the nature of the employee's role, and the employee's level of responsibility;
whether the additional hours are in accordance with averaging terms under the FW Act.

Averaging hours
The NES allows for a modern award or enterprise agreement to include terms providing for the averaging of hours of work over a specified period (though there appears to be no limit as to what the specified period might be).
For employees who are award and agreement free, they and their employer may, in writing, agree to an averaging arrangement under which hours of work over a specified period of not more than 26 weeks are averaged.
3.	NES: Request for Flexible Working Arrangements
Under the FW Act, the following employees have a right to request a flexible working arrangement:
•	a parent, or person who has responsibility for the care, of a child who is of school age (i.e. the age at which a child is required by law to attend school) or younger;
•	a carer (as defined by the Carer Recognition Act 2010) which includes those who provide care, support and assistance to a person who requires support due to a disability, medical condition, mental illness or fragility due to age;
•	an employee with a disability;
•	an employee that is 55 or older;
•	an employee, or a member of their immediate family or household, experiencing family and domestic violence
•	an employee that provides care or support to a member of their immediate family, or a member of their household, who requires care or support because the member is experiencing violence from the member's family.
An employer may only refuse a flexible working request on "reasonable business grounds", which under the FW Act include:
•	that the new working arrangements would be too costly for the employer;
•	that there is no capacity to change the working arrangements of other employees to accommodate the requested work arrangements;
•	that it would be impractical to change the working arrangements of other employees, or recruit new employees, to accommodate the requested working arrangements;
that the requested working arrangements would be likely to result in a significant loss in efficiency or productivity; 
Chamber of Commerce andlndu!tryWA
 
.. 16
 
•	that the requested working arrangements would be likely to have a significant negative impact on customer service.
This list is not intended to be exhaustive and such grounds will be determined having regard to the circumstances of each workplace and the nature of the request made.
Flexible working arrangements could include condensed hours, part-time work, job­ sharing, special-leave provisions, working from home or other arrangements.
To access the entitlement an employee must have completed at least 12 months of continuous service with the employer before making a request. A casual employee who has been engaged by the employer on a regular and systematic basis during a period of at least 12 months and has a reasonable expectation of continuing employment is also entitled to make a request.
The request must be in writing and must set out details of the change sought and reasons for  the change.  The employer must give the employee a written response to the request within 21 days, statingwhetherthe employer grants or refuses the request. The employer may refuse the request only on reasonable business grounds. If the employer refuses the request, the written response must include the reasons for the refusal.
It is not explicitly possible under the NES for an employer to be prosecuted for refusing to grant a request. However, there will be indirect ways where employers will be held to account. Firstly, depending on the circumstances, such a refusal may be considered discrimination. Secondly, if an enterprise agreement includes dispute settlement procedures which relate to a term which is the same or substantially the same as the NES right to request provisions then The Fair Work Commission will be able to deal with such a dispute.
Flexible Working Arrangements Reform
On 2 December 2022, the Fair Work Legislation Amendment(Securejobs, Better Pay)Act 2022 (Amendment Act 2022) was passed by the par\ iament. The Amendment Act 2022 expanded the circumstances employees can request flexible working arrangements. The circumstances in regard to family and domestic violence leave have been expanded to remove the requirement that the perpetrator be a family member, allowing employees who experience violence from others to access the leave. Additionally, a pregnant employee can now request a flexible working arrangement to assist them to engage in work, whilst protecting their wellbeing during their pregnancy.
Furthermore, the obligations of an employer in regard to refusing a flexible working arrangement request have also been extended. The new process requires:
•	both parties to discuss the request and try to reach a genuine agreement; and
•	the employer responding in writing to the employee within 21 days of receiving the request.

Chamber of Commerce
andlndllllryWA	·	·
 
o	If the request is granted, the response is to include details of the new working arrangement.
If the request is declined, the response need to include the reasonable business grounds for the declining the request and any other working arrangement the employer can accommodate (if any).
The Amendment Act 2022 also introduced new powers for the Fair Work -Commission (FWC), allowing the regulatory body to resolve disputes and issue penalties for breach of this provision of the Act. The FWC will have the power to conciliate or mediate disputes in the first instance, making recommendations to parties or expressing an opinion on the matter. If the dispute is unable to be resolved, the FWC can arbitrate the dispute and issues binding orders.
These new provisions in regard to flexible working arrangements became effective on 6 June 2023.
Interaction with State laws
Unlike other provisions contained in the FW Act, the right to request flexible working arrangement provisions are not intended to apply to the exclusion of other state laws that might otherwise apply.
These provisions are not new. Under state and federal discrimination laws it is possible for an employee to bring a claim of direct or indirect discrimination based on family responsibilities. However, the accessibility for employees has been significantly broadened under the NES.
Employers need to carefully consider any request for flexible working arrangements. If there is a decision to deny a request the employer must cite business grounds. This could include excessive cost - such as the cost of setting up a working-from-home arrangement; excessive disruptions - such as changing arrangements for everyone in an office to suit an individual's needs; and impracticality - such as if a business is technically incapable of adjusting to the employee's requirements.
4.	NES: Offersand requests to convert from casual to permanent employment
Under the new definition effective from 26 August 2024, an employee is classified as a 'casual employee' only if specific conditions are met.
1.	First the employment relationship is characterised by an absence of a firm advance commitment to continuing and indefinite work.
2.	Secondly, the employee is entitled under an award/enterprise agreement or contract of employment to be paid a casual loading or a specific rate of pay for casual employees.
 

Chamberof Commerce andlnd1111TyWA
 

- 18
 
To determine whether there is a 'firm advance commitment to continuing and indefinite work the act requires consideration of:
•	The 'Real substance, practical reality and true nature of the employment relationship' between the parties.
This means the totality of the relationship not just the terms of the contract must be considered. A firm advance commitment may be in the form of a mutually agreed term in a contract of employment in addition to a mutual understanding or expectation between an employer and employee.
This means how the contract is written and/or performed including the conduct of an employer and employee after entering into an employment contract can infer a firm advance commitment.
Unless a casual satisfies the relevant tests and actually chooses to become permanent, they are not going to convert to permanency.
The Employee Choice process:
A casual employee can issue a written notification to their employer if they would like to change their employment status to full-time or part-time employment if:
•	the employee believes they no longer meet the definition of casual employment definition; and
•	they have been employed for a period of 6 months at the time the notification is given (or 12 months for small business employers).
When an employer receives a written notification from a casual employee, they must respond within 21 days. Before providing a response, employers are required to consult with the employee regarding the notification. If the employer decides to accept the notification and transition the employee from casual to permanent status, they must discuss the following matters with the employee and confirm the details in their acceptance letter:
•	If the employee is converting to full time or part time employment;
•	The agreed hours of work after the change;
•	The day of the change, which must be the beginning of the first pay period after the employer's response unless otherwise agreed between the employer and the employee.
The grounds for an employer to not accept a notification include:
•	The employee still meets the definition of casual employment;
•	Accepting the notification would affect compliance with a recruitment or selection process required under a law of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory; or
"  There are fair and reasonable operational grounds for declining.

Chamberof(ommerce andlndustryWA
 
The Fair Work Commission can deal with any disputes about refusals.

5.	NES: Parental Leave and Related Entitlements
Parental leave is leave that can be taken after:
..	an employee gives birth

•	an employee's spouse or de facto partner gives birth
•	an employee adopts a child under 16 years of age.
Eligible employees are entitled to up to 12 months of unpaid parental leave. They can also request up to an additional 12 months of leave.
An employee continues is entitled to 12 months' unpaid parental leave if the leave is associated with the birth or adoption of a child. However, an employee has the right to request a further 12 months of unpaid leave, up to a period of 24 months.
Employees (other than casual employees) are eligible for the leave once they have completed at least 12 months' continuous service with the employer. Casual employees are eligible once they have been engaged on a regular and systematic basis for at least 12 months and have a reasonable expectation of ongoing employment.
An employee must provide written notice of the intention to take unpaid parental leave at least 10 weeks before starting the leave. The notice must specify the start and end dates of the leave.
Medical certificate may be requested 6 weeks before the birth
If a pregnant employee who is entitled to parental leave continues to work during the period of 6 weeks before the expected date of birth of the child, the employer may ask the employee to provide a medical certificate containing a statement of whether the employee is fit to work and if the employee is fit to work-a statement of whether it is inadvisable for the employee to continue in her present position.
If the employee does not give the employer the requested certificate within 7 days after the request or if the medical certificate states that the employee is not fit for work the employer may require the employee to take a period of unpaid parental leave.
Varying a period of unpaid parental leave
If an employee does not elect to take the full 12 months available at first instance, that employee may extend the period of unpaid parental leave by giving the employer written notice at least 4 weeks before the end date of the original leave period. The employer is obliged to agree to an extension of unpaid parental leave on one occasion only and subject to the required notice being provided. The notice must specify the new end date for the leave. Any subsequent extensions are only granted if the employer agrees.
Chamb"orcommerce
andlndustryWA	20
 
Similarly, if the employer agrees, an employee may reduce the period of unpaid parental leave he or she takes.

Right to request further 12 months
An employee who takes unpaid parental leave has the right to request an extension of unpaid parental leave for a further period of up to 12 months.
The request must be in writing and must be given to the employer at least 4 weeks before the end of the original parental leave period. The employer must agree to the requested extension unless the employer has reasonable business grounds for refusing. Further, an employer must not refuse a request unless the employee has been given an opportunity to discuss the request.
The same issues that arise in refusing a request for flexible working arrangements will also arise under this provision.
Extending Unpaid Parental Leave Reform
The Amendment Act 2022 expanded the obligations of an employer in regard to refusing a request for an additional period of unpaid parental leave. Employers need to respond to an employee's request in writing within 21 days and highlight whether the extension is granted or declined and the details of the extension, i.e. the period of leave etc.
An employer may only decline a parental leave extension request where they have:
•	discussed the request with the employee;
•	genuinely attempted to reach an agreement;
•	taken into consideration the impact to the employee; and
•	reasonable business grounds.
In instances where the employer declines the request, the written response also needs to include detailed reasons for the decline.
Similar to the flexible work arrangement provisions, the powers of the FWC have been expanded to deal with disputes regarding parental leave extensions where the employer and employee have been unable to resolve it at a workplace level. Whilst the FWC have the ability to arbitrate the matter, they may only do so after other means have been unsuccessful (unless there is exceptional circumstances).
These new provisions in regard to unpaid parental leave became effective on 6June 2023.

Special Maternity Leave
A female employee is entitled to a period of unpaid special maternity leave if she is unfit for work because she has a pregnancy-related illness or she has been pregnant, and the pregnancy ends after at least 12 weeks of gestation (excluding stillborn). The entitlement to 12 months' unpaid parental leave is not reduced by the amount of any unpaid special maternity leave taken by the employee while she was pregnant.

Transfer to a safe job
A female employee who gives evidence that would satisfy a reasonable person (which may be a medical certificate) that she is fit to work but that it is inadvisable for her to continue in her present position during a stated risk period because of illness, or risks, arising out of her pregnancy or hazards connected with that position, must be transferred to an appropriate safe job for the risk period.
While carrying out the safe job there must be no changes to the employee's terms and conditions and the employee must be paid their full rate of pay (for the position she occupied before the transfer) for the hours that she works in the risk period. The full rate of pay of an employee includes incentive-based payments and bonuses; loadings; monetary allowances; overtime or penalty rates.
If there is no appropriate safe job available, the employee is entitled to take paid no safe job leave for the risk period. If this occurs, the employer must pay the employee at the employee's base rate of pay for the employee's ordinary hours of work in the risk period.
The entitlement to transfer to a safe job also includes employees who do not have, or will not have, an entitlement to unpaid parental leave (i.e. have been employed for less than twelve months). Additionally, where a safe job is not available, employees who do not have an entitlement to unpaid parental leave will be entitled to unpaid no safe job leave.
Consultation with employee on unpaid parental leave
If, while an employee is on unpaid parental leave, the employer makes a decision that will have a significant effect on the status, pay or location of the employee's pre-parental leave position, the employer must take all reasonable steps to inform and discuss with the employee the effect of the decision.
Return to work guarantee
An employee is entitled to return to their pre-parental leave position on finishing unpaid parental leave. If that position no longer exists, the employee is entitled to return to an available position for which the employee is qualified and suited nearest in status and pay to the pre-parental leave position.
Unpaid pre-adoption leave
In the circumstance of adoption, an employee is entitled to up to 2 days of unpaid pre-adoption  leave  to  attend  any  interviews  or  examinations  required  to obtain approval for the employee's adoption of a child.
An employee is not entitled to take unpaid pre-adoption leave if the employee could instead take some other form of leave and the employer directs the employee to take that other form of leave.

6.	NES:Annualleave
An employee, other than a casual employee, is entitled to 4 weeks of paid annual leave for each year of service with his or her employer.
Shift workers (as defined by the modern award, enterprise agreement or the NES if award/agreement free) are entitled to 5 weeks of paid annual leave. Under the NES a shift worker is defined as an employee who is employed in an enterprise in which shifts are continuously rostered 24 hours a day for 7 days a week; is regularly rostered to work those shifts; and regularly works on Sundays and public holidays.
Annual leave accrues progressively under the NES during a year of service according to the employee's ordinary hours of work. Payment for a period of annual leave is made at the employee's base rate of pay for the employee's ordinary hours of work in the period.
On termination, an employer must pay the employee any periods of untaken annual leave.
The NES also provides that an employee is taken not to be on annual leave at certain times. If a public holiday falls during a period of annual leave, an employee is taken not to be on annual leave for that day. Similarly, if a period of annual leave includes a period of personal/carer's leave or community services leave, an employee is taken not to be on annual leave during that period. In this circumstance, an employee would need to provide the same evidence that is required under the personal/carer's leave NES.
Cashing out annual leave
Employees may cash out their annual leave under the NES. A modern award or an enterprise agreement may include terms providing for cashing out of paid annual leave. An award/agreement covered employee may only cash out their annual leave in accordance with the award/agreement terms. However, it is not possible to cash out annual leave if the cashing out would result in the employee's remaining accrued entitlement being less than 4 weeks. Further, each cashing out of a particular amount of paid annual leave must be by a separate agreement in writing between the employer and the employee and the employee must be paid at least the full amount that would have been payable to the employee had the employee taken the leave that the employee has forgone.
Cashing out of annual leave is also possible for award/agreement free employees. The same restrictions apply as those mentioned above - it is not possible to cash out annual leave if it would result in the employee's remaining accrued entitlement being less than 4 weeks; each period of cashing out must be made by a separate agreement in writing between the employer and the employee and the employee must be paid at least the full amount that would have been payable to the employee had the employee taken the leave.
•	Chaml><!rll1Commem andlndu1trvw
 
Other annual leave provisions
A modern award or enterprise agreement can contain terms which require an employee to take accrued annual leave in particular circumstances. This may include requiring an employee to take a period of annual leave to reduce excessive accrual or if the employer decides to shut down the workplace over the Christmas/New Year period.
The NES also allows for a modern award or enterprise agreement to include other terms about the taking of paid annual leave such as the taking of paid annuaf leave in advance of accrual.
Transitional instruments which contain certain other provisions relating to annual leave will continue to have effect. For example, if a collective agreement made before 1 July 2009 states that an employee can be directed to take annual leave after an 'excessive' amount has accrued, this clause will still apply after 1 January 2010.
Similarly, an employer and award/agreement free employees may agree on when and how paid annual leave may be taken by the employee. For example, this woul1d include such matters as taking paid annual leave in advance of accrual; that paid annual leave must be taken within a fixed period of time after it is accrued; the form of application for paid annual leave and that a specified period of notice must be given before taking paid annual leave.
Annual leave and workers' compensation
An employee is not entitled to take or accrue annual leave (whether paid or unpaid) during a period of workers' compensation unless it is permitted by compensation legislation. In WA, the relevant legislation is the Workers' Compensation and Injury Management Act 1981 (WA) (the Workers Compensation Act).
The Workers' Compensation Act does not expressly make refence to an employee's ability to take and accrue annual leave during a period of workers' compensation. However, recent case law (Touheyv Salini Australia Pty Ltd [2022] FCA 55) determined that the Workers Compensation Act permits the dual receipt of compensation and annual leave benefits. As such, annual leave continues to accrue during periods when an employee is absent from work because of a personal illness or personal injury.
Furthermore, employees on workers' compensation can take annual leave during a compensation period, as the Workers' Compensation Act does not prevent or prohibit or restrain an employee from doing so.

NES: Personal/Carer's Leave and Compassionate Leave/Family and Domestic Violence Leave

•	Chamberof Commerce
and Industry WA	24
 
Employees are entitled to 10 days of paid personal/carer's leave for each year of service with his or her employer. Personal/carer's leave also continues to accumulate from year to year.
Paid personal/carer's leave accrues progressively during a year of service according to the employee's ordinary hours of work and is paid at the employee's base rate of pay for the employee's ordinary hours of work in the period. This means the yearly entitlement is based on an employee's ordinary hours of work and is 10 days for full-time employees, and pro-rata for part-time employees. This can be calculated as 1/26 of an employee's ordinary hours of work in a year. The amount of paid sick and carer's leave accumulated over a period is not affected by differences in the spread of an employee's ordinary hours of work in a week.
An employee may take paid personal/carer's leave because:
•	the employee is unfit for work because of a personal illness or injury; or
•	to provide care or support to a member of the employee's immediate family or household, who requires care or support because of a personal illness or injury or because of an unexpected emergency affecting the member.
Cashing out personal/carers leave
It is only possible to cash out personal/carer's leave if a modern award or enterprise agreement contains such provisions. It is not possible to enter into such an arrangement if employees are award or agreement free.
If a provision to cash out personal/carer's leave is included in a modern award or enterprise agreement it must state that:
•	leave cannot be cashed out if it would result in the remaining accrual being less than 15 days;
•	each period of cashing out must be by a separate agreement in writing between the employer and the employee; and
•	the employee must be paid at least the full amount that would have been payable had the employee taken the leave.
Unpaid carers' leave
All employees (including casual employees) are entitled to 2 days of unpaid carer's leave for each occasion that a member of the employee's immediate family or household requires care or support because of a personal illness or injury or because of an unexpected emergency.ChamberolCommerce
andlnduslr1WA	 
 
Compassionate leave
An employee is entitled to 2 days of paid compassionate leave for each occasion that a member of the employee's immediate family or household contracts or develops a personal illness that poses a serious threat to his or her life; sustains a personal injury that poses a serious threat to his or her life; or dies. An employee is also entitled to compassionate leave where they or their spouse/de facto partner have a miscarriage, or in relation to a stillborn child who would have been a member of the employee's immediate family or a member of the employee's household, if the child had been born alive.
Family and Domestic Violence Leave
As of 1 February 2023, all employees (excluding those employed by small business employers) are entitled to 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave in a 12 month period (separate to personal/carers leave) where the employee is experience family and domestic violence; and the employee needs to do something to deal with the impact of the family and domestic violence; and it is impractical for the employee to do that thing outside the employees ordinary hours of work.
The entitlement became available from 1 August 2023 for employees of small business employers (less than 1S employees).
Evidence and notice
An employee who is taking personal/carer's leave must give notice to the employer as soon as is reasonably practicable (which may be a time after the leave has started) and must advise the employer of the period, or expected period, of the leave.
If required by the employer, an employee must provide evidence that would satisfy 'a reasonable person'. What evidence would satisfy a reasonable person will differ depending on the circumstances and may or may not include a medical certificate.
However, the NES provides that a modern award or enterprise agreement may include more onerous provisions in relation to the kind of evidence that an employee must give in order to be entitled to paid personal/carer's leave, unpaid carer's leave or compassionate leave. Likewise, transitional instruments which contain more onerous evidence provisions will continue to have effect. For example, if a collective agreement made before 1 July 2009 states that a medical certificate must be provided for each period of personal leave, this clause will still apply after 1 January 2010.
Personal/Carer's leave and Workers' Compensation
An employee is not entitled to take or accrue personal/carer's leave (whether paid or unpaid) during a period of workers' compensation unless the accrual or taking of the 
•	Chamberof (ommerce
andlndustryWA
 
-·· ·- 26
 
leave is permitted by compensation legislation. In WA, the relevant legislation is the Workers Compensation Act.
The Workers Compensation Act states that an employee is not entitled to receive any payments for sick leave entitlements during any period of paid workers' compensation.
However, the Workers Compensation Act is silent as to accrual of personal leave. As discussed above, recent case law confirmed that annual leave accrues during periods of workers' compensation in that State. However, the decision did not deal with personal/carer's leave. Therefore, whether personal/carer's leave should accrue during periods of workers' compensation in WA may currently be unclear. Employers are encouraged to seek advice in this regard.
7.	NES: Community Service Leave
Voluntary emergency management activities (such as being a volunteer fire fighter or part of the SES) and jury service are defined by the NES as 'eligible community service activities'.
The NES provides that employees undertaking such activities are entitled to be absent from their employment.
Unlike other provisions contained in the FW Act, the community services leave provisions are not intended to apply to the exclusion of state or territory laws that might otherwise apply to the extent that such laws would be more generous. In WA, there are two relevant pieces of legislation which must be considered in light of the NES provisions, the juries Act 1957 (WA) and the Emergency Management Act 2005 (WA).

Jury Service
The NES provides that employees, other than casual employees, who receive a jury service summons, must be paid at their base rate of pay for up to a maximum of 10 days. However, under Juries Act 1957 (WA), an employer is obligated to continue to pay employee wages for the entire period of jury service. Employers can then seek reimbursement from the Sheriff's Office.
Voluntary emergency management activities
While the NES provides that all activities other than jury service are to be taken as unpaid leave, under the Emergency Management Act 2005 (WA) an employee who is absent from employment because of an emergency management response is entitled to be paid by the employer for the period of absence.

Long Service Leave
The following summarises the operation of the long service leave provisions (LSL) under the NES and the rules for how LSL is dealt with in enterprise agreements after commencement of the NES:
•	In general, if your employees are bound by an award prior to the commencement of the NES, then the long service leave entitlements in that award are preserved and continue to operate.
•	If your agreement prior to the commencement of the NES contains LSL entitlements, then generally those entitlements are preserved and continue to operate.
•	If your employees do not have award or agreement derived LSL entitlements, then the State LSL provisions will apply. In WA, most employees' entitlements are derived from the Long Service Leave Act 1958. The main details of this Act are summaries in the table below.

Long Service Leave Act 1958
First entitlement	8 2/3 weeks after ten (10) years continuous service.
Subsequent entitlements	4 1/3 weeks after five (5) years continuous service.
Rate of pay (waged/salaried etc.)	At the ordinary rate applicable at the time leave commences.
Excludes shift premiums, overtime, penalty rates, allowances, or the like.
Rate of pay (where employee is employed on piece or bonus work or any other system of payment by results)	The ordinary rate payable shall be determined by averaging the weekly rate earned in the previous twelve (12) months.
Number of hours to be paid	Normal weekly number of hours of work.
Where weekly hours over the period of employment have varied, the 'normal weekly hours' are determined by averaging the weekly hours worked during the entire period of employment.
Payment to be made	At the same time payment is made in the normal course of employment, unless the employee has requested in writing to be paid before leave begins, in which case the employer must comply.

Long Service Leave Act 1958	 I

When leave must be taken	Subject to any agreement between employer and employee, as soon as 'reasonably practicable' after it becomes due.
If the employer and employee cannot agree, where the employee has accrued long service leave more than twelve
(12) months ago, the employer is not to refuse the employee taking the leave at any time suitable to the employee.
Separate periods	One continuous period, or if by agreement, in separate periods.
Notice required	By agreement or by the employee giving the employer at least two (2) weeks' notice.
Postponement of leave	Whereby agreement LSL is postponed to meet the employee's convenience, the rate of pay for such leave shall be the rate applicable to the date of accrual (unless employer agrees to pay the rate applicable when the leave is taken).
Leave in advance	Is allowed by agreement. If sufficient leave is not subsequently accrued upon termination of employment, the employer may make a deduction equivalent to the LSL granted in advance, from monies owing to the employee on termination.
Payment in lieu on termination	Pro rata leave is paid upon death or termination after at least seven (7) years continuous service (except for serious misconduct) in accordance with the following:
•	Where at least seven (7) years continuous service has been completed but less than ten (10), proportionate LSL is payable and is calculated on completed years, months, and days of service with the employer.
•	Where more than ten (10) years of continuous service has been completed, LSL is payable pro­ rata on fully completed years of service only.
Termination for serious misconduct	Forfeiture of accrued pro rata leave.
Public holidays	If the relevant conditions of employment provide an entitlement to public holidays and a public holiday falls during a period of LSL, the LSL shall be increased by one day for each public holiday falling within that period. Annual leave which may fall due during LSL is not absorbed.

Other work	Employee not permitted to engage in any employment in substitution for the employment from which the employee is on leave, otherwise the right to the remaining leave is forfeited.
Cashing out	Employer and employee may agree (in writing) that the employee forego his or her entitlement to LSL if the employee is given an "adequate benefit in lieu of entitlement".
A benefit is not adequate unless the employee is paid at least the amount they wouId have received had they taken the LSL entitlements.
Agreement cannot be reached to cash out LSL before the employee's entitlement to LSL is accrued. Agreement to cash out LSL can only be made once the employee has completed the required continuous employment and accrued the full entitlement.
Detailed records are required to be retained when providing an adequate benefit in lieu. Records to be retained will need to include the employer's name and ABN, the date of any transfer of business, the weekly hours worked by each employee, and details of any cashing out of LSL.
Exclusions	Where an award, enterprise or workplace agreement, state or federal laws or other agreement between employee and employer provides an LSL entitlement 'at least equivalent' to the LSL Act, the LSL Act does not apply at all.

8.	NES: Public Holidays
The NES provides for an employee to receive payment at their base rate of pay for being absent on a day that is a public holiday.
If the employee does not have ordinary hours of work on the public holiday, the employee is not entitled to payment. For example, an employee is not entitled to payment if they are a part-time employee whose part-time hours do not include the day of the week on which the public holiday occurs.
Casual employees are not expressly excluded from payment for being absent on a public holiday. However, payment would not be required so long as casual employees are not rostered on for the public holiday. Employers must ensure that casual employees are clearly not rostered on the public holiday to reduce the liability of payment.
If a public holiday falls while an employee is on a period of annual leave or personal/carers leave, the employee is considered not to be on annual leave or personal/cares leave for that public holiday. As such, where applicable, it is paid to the employee as a public holiday.
An employer may request an employee to work on a public holiday if the request is reasonable. Employers must ensure that it is clear to employees that they have a choice to work the public holiday, although employees cannot unreasonably refuse the request (CFMMEU v OS MCAP Pty Ltd [2023] FCAFC 51). In determining whether a request, or a refusal of a request, is reasonable, the following must be considered:
a.	the nature of the employer's workplace or enterprise (including its operational requirements), and the nature of the work performed by the employee;
b.	the employee's personal circumstances, including family responsibilities;
c.	whether the employee could reasonably expect that the employer might request work on the public holiday;
d.	whether the employee is entitled to receive overtime payments, penalty rates or other compensation for, or a level of remuneration that reflects an expectation of, work on the public holiday;
e.	the type of employment of the employee (for example, whether full-time, part-time, casual or shift work);
f.	the amount of notice in advance of the public holiday given by the employer when making the request;
g.	in relation to the refusal of a request-the amount ofnotice in advance of the public holiday given by the employee when refusing the request;

•	ciamberofCommerce
andln<lustryWA
 
any other relevant matter.
"""	(hambero![omm<!lce
aadlndustryWA
 
The NES also provides for substitution under a relevant state or territory law and further provides that a modern award or agreement may substitute (or provide for the substitution of) a day or part-day for a day or part-day that would otherwise be a public holiday.
9.	NES: Notice of Termination and Redundancy Pay
Notice of Termination
When terminating an employee, an employer must give written notice of the day of the termination (which cannot be before the day the notice is given). How notice may be given is determined by the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 and may be given to an employee by delivering it personally; leaving it at the employee's last known address; or sending it by pre-paid post to the employee's last known address.
The employer must provide the correct notice period or pay the employee in lieu of notice at the full rate of pay for the hours he or she would have worked had the employment continued until the end of the minimum period of notice. This includes payment of superannuation during the notice period.
The notice period under the NES applies to both National System Employers and State System Employers:
-


The NES also provides that a modern award or enterprise agreement may include provisions specifying the period of notice an employee must give to terminate his or her employment.
The notice of termination provisions do not apply in respect of the following employees:
•	a daily hire employee working in the building and construction industry;
•	a daily hire employee working in the meat industry; or
•	a weekly hire employee working in connection with the meat industry and whose termination of employment is determined solely by seasonal factors.
 
......, Chamberl)f Comrr,erce
and lndullryWA
 
-	�33
 
Redundancy Pay
Under the NES an employee is entitled to redundancy pay if they are terminated at the employer's initiative because the employer no longer requires the job done by the employee to be done by anyone (except where this is due to the ordinary and customary turnover of labour); or because of the insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer.
The following redundancy payments are made at the employee's base rate of pay for his or her ordinary hours of work:

Period of continuous service with the employer on termination	Redundancy pay period
At least 1 year and less than 2 years	4 weeks' pay
At least 2 years and less than 3 years	6 weeks' pay
At least 3 years and less than 4 years	7 weeks' pay
At least 4 years and less than 5 years	8 weeks' pay
At least 5 years and less than 6 years	10 weeks' pay
At least 6 years cind less than 7 years	11 weeks' pay
·
At least 7 years and less than 8 years	13 weeks' pay
At least 8 years and less than 9 years	14 weeks' pay
At least 9 years and less than 10 years	16 weeks' pay
At least 10 years	12 weeks' pay
On application by the employer, The Fair Work Commission may determine that the amount of redundancy pay is reduced because the employer obtains other acceptable alternative employment or because of an incapacity to pay the amount.
An employer may also be obliged to make a more generous severance payment in the following circumstances:
•	where there is a specific entitlement to more generous severance payments in the employee's contract of employment;
•	where the employee is covered by an industrial award or industrial agreement containing such an entitlement;
where the employer has a redundancy policy providing for a severance payment which is either expressly incorporated into the contract of employment or is of general application, it could be argued to be an implied term, and;Chamber of Commerce
andlndustryW	34
 
•	employers should be consistent in the application of severance to all employees to avoid allegations of unfairness.
The NES provides that the following exclusions from redundancy pay apply:
•	Number of employees - if the employer employed fewer than 15 employees at the time the employee is given notice of the termination or immediately before the termination;
•	Service - If the period of continuous service with the employer on termination is less than 12 months;
•	An employee who is an apprentice;
•	An employee covered by a modern award that includes an industry-specific redundancy scheme; and
•	An employee covered by an enterprise agreement which incorporates by reference an industry specific redundancy scheme contained in a modern award which applies to that employee.
For the purpose of calculating the number of employees, all employees employed by the employer at that time are to be counted, including the employee whose employment is being terminated and any other employee whose employment is also being terminated. A casual employee is not counted unless the casual employee has, immediately before that time, been engaged by the employer on a regular and systematic basis for a sequence  of  periods  of  employment  during  a  period  of  at  least 12 months.
A modern award may include a term specifying other situations in which redundancy pay would not apply to the termination of an employee's employment. If a modern award does include such a term, an enterprise agreement may incorporate the term by reference into the enterprise agreement. Such a term would only apply to those employees who are covered by the modern award.
Exemptions to notice of termination and redundancy
Further to the above-mentioned exemptions, the following employees are also exempt from both the notice of termination provisions and the redundancy provisions:
•	an employee employed for a specified period or for a specified task;
•	an employee	whose employment	is terminated because	of serious misconduct;

11.	Case Studies
Below are cases that demonstrate the potential consequences of failure to comply with obligations under the NES

Case Summary
HR failings help pregnant worker win big payout
A national transport company was ordered to pay $25,000 to an employee after it responded to her request for modified duties while pregnant by unilaterally changing her role and cutting her pay by $18,000. The employee was employed by Allied Express Transport Pty Ltd as a customer service and accounts manager in January 2010, having previously worked for the company from 2003 until 2007. Her role required her to spend up to half of each week on the road visiting clients, for which she used her own car and received a vehicle allowance of $5000.
In April 2010, the employee informed the employer she was pregnant and they agreed that from October 2010, she would commence six (6) months unpaid maternity leave and then return to her role. In August 2010, the employee and the employer's state manager discussed that she was finding the constant travel and long hours difficult and tiring. The manager offered to explore whether the client manager part of her job (which involved the travel) could be temporarily allocated to another employee, and that this might mean she would lose the vehicle allowance. The employee also discussed the issue with the employer's Managing Director, particularly the possibility that she would lose the allowance and take a pay cut because of the role change, but no agreement was reached. A short time later the state manager informed the employee that the employer had approved the role change, but that she would have to take a $10,000 pay cut and would also lose responsibility for managing customer service. The employee expressed strong reservations about the changes, but at a meeting in August 2010 she was presented with a new employment contract, prepared by the employer's Human Resources Manager, confirming her transfer to a telephonist/customer service role on a $60,000 package. The employee refused to sign the contract and walked out of the meeting. Subsequently, she was given another employment contract, this time confirming she was now to be paid $52,000 including super.
During a week of annual leave, the employee's lawyers wrote to the employer stating that she had not agreed to the changes and considered that she had been dismissed. The employer replied that it had sought to satisfy her request to stop travelling and that she could retain her $70,000 package if she agreed to undertake the travel required by the role. The employee rejected this proposition and shortly afterwards lodged an unfair dismissal claim with Fair Work Australia (FWA). Before FWA, the employee argued that Allied Express had repudiated her employment contract and accordingly, she had been dismissed within the meaning of section 386 of the Act.
FWA held that such cases as O'Meara v Stanley Works Pty Ltd had established that FWA had to determine whether the employer's conduct "was of such a nature that the conclusion of the employment relationship was the probable result or that the [employee]'s

{hamberorcomrnerce
andl114ustryW	·---------------	37
 
actions to accept the repudiation was forced by the course of conduct of the employer". It concluded that the evidence demonstrated that whilst the employee and employer had agreed in-principle to the idea that she would stop travelling, the details of the change in role and its consequences for her remuneration remained in dispute. It was probable that the employer's decision to unilaterally push ahead with the changes would result in the conclusion of the employment relationship.
FWA also considered that the employee had not contacted the employer's Managing Director after she was told her pay would be cut to $60,000. It was also relevant, however, that "despite knowledge within the organisation that the [employee] had expressed serious concerns about the proposals and the apparent motive of the employer, and later refused to sign the amended terms of employment, no one within Human Resources or a decision maker from head office contacted [her] during that period". The Commissioner found the employer had no valid reason for terminating the employee and that she had been unfairly dismissed. It was accepted that the employee was a good worker, he said, and there was "no basis to change her role or remuneration package in light of her refusal to accept those changes". The employer's relatively large size and the fact that it had a dedicated Human Resources Department, was also considered.
The employee's refusal to accept the new lower-paid role did not mean she had failed to mitigate her loss, given that the employer's conduct represented a "major breach of the fabric of the employment relationship". The Commissioner ordered the employer to pay the former employee an amount of $25,821 in compensation, including 9% to be paid into her superannuation account.

The company took the action on the basis that it was a "safe job" after the employee produced medical evidence regarding lifting restrictions associated with her pregnancy.
After an investigation by the Fair Work Ombudsman, Coles voluntarily:
•	Ensured its management teams in all stores understand the National Employment Standards (NES),
•	Completed a review of company policy in relation to the transfer of pregnant employees to safe jobs to ensure it complies with the NES,
•	Launched Online training for all line managers regarding the company's obligations to pregnant employees,
•	Audited its payroll system to determine if any other pregnant employees transferred to safe jobs were also underpaid, and
•	Apologised to the affected employees for taking action against them.
As part of an Enforceable Undertaking, published on the Fair Work Ombudsman website, Coles agreed to:
1.	Reimburse other pregnant workers found to have been underpaid because of the former policy,
2.	Post a notice about the rights of pregnant employees in all its stores for a period of at least 30 days,
3.	Train supervisors on company obligations to pregnant employees, and
Donate $20,000 to Jobwatch Australia to fund educational activities for pregnant employees about their rights under the FW Act.

Modern Awards
 

Modern Awards set minimum terms and conditions for national system employees in particular industries or occupations.
The first 122 modern awards commenced on 1 January 2010.
]	While modern awards commenced on 1 January 2010, most contain transitional arrangements which specify when particular parts of a
modern award come into effect. Some transitional arrangements appear in clauses in the main part of the award, some may also appear in a schedule. The standard transitional arrangements ceased on 1 July 2014.
 
f

Transitional arrangements dealt with:
•	minimum wages and piecework rates
•	casual or part-time loadings
•	Saturday, Sunday, public holiday, evening or other penalties
•	shift allowances/penalties.
The making of a modern award (and the operation of any transitional arrangements within a modern award) is not intended to result in a reduction in the take-home pay of employees covered by such award.Section 45 of the Act stipulates that a person must not contravene a term of a modern award.

Enterprise Agreements
The Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) (the FW Act) provides for single or multi-enterprise agreements for either an existing business or for a genuine new enterprise (Greenfields). The FW Act also allows for a stream of multi-enterprise agreement for low paid employees.
Single Enterprise Agreement
Whilst single enterprise agreements will generally be made by a single employer, they may also be made with two or more employers where they are a related body corporate or engaged in a joint venture or common enterprise.
Multiple employers that are franchisees can also apply to be classified as a single enterprise through a "single interest employer authorisation".
Multi EnterpriseAgreement
Two or more employers (who are not deemed a single enterprise) can agree to bargain together for a single enterprise agreement. Majority support determinations, scope orders, good faith bargaining orders, protected industrial action or workplace determinations are not available in relation to bargaining for multi-enterprise agreements.
Low Paid Multi Enterprise Agreement
The system provides unions with the ability to seek a low paid authorisation from the Fair Work Commission for the purpose of making a multi-enterprise agreement for employees who are substantially paid minimum safety net terms and conditions where there has not been a history of enterprise bargaining.
Greenfield Agreement
A Greenfields Agreement may be made by a genuine new enterprise, either as a single enterprise or multi-enterprise agreement with the relevant union(s), where it has not employed any of the persons who will be necessary for the normal conduct of that enterprise. A genuine new enterprise includes a genuine new business, project or undertaking.

The Amendment Act 2022 introduced 3 categories of multi-employer bargaining:
•	Single interest bargaining;
•	Supported bargaining; and
•	Co-operative bargaining.

Single interest bargaining
A single interest employer agreement is an enterprise agreement between two or more
1	employers who have a common interest.
Effective from 27 February 2024, franchisees of a common franchisor can voluntarily
bargain together for a single enterprise agreement. This means that when employees vote to approve an agreement, they will vote as a single cohort rather than franchise-by­
franchise. However, the ability to negotiate single enterprise agreements and multi­
l	enterprise agreements on a franchise-by-franchise basis is still possible.
Section 172 of FW Act.

Note: This provision is a new insertion introduced by the Fair Work Legislation
 Amendment (Closing Loopholes No. 2) Act 2023.	Supported bargaining
A supported bargaining agreement is an enterprise agreement that occurs when the FWC makes a supported bargaining authorisation where it feels it is appropriate for employers and employees to bargain together having regard to:
•	prevailing pay and conditions in the industry
•	if there are clearly identifiable common interests in the employers
•	the likely number of bargaining representatives and if it would be manageable
•	and at least some of the employees to be covered are represented by an organisation.
Cooperative workplaces
A cooperative employer agreement is an enterprise agreement arrangement applicable to funding industries (e.g. social and community sector), where an employer can seek to join other employers to make an agreement.

1.	Overview
The Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) (FW Act) requires employers to keep specific employee records. Many awards and agreements also require employers to keep records, such as time and wages records. The FW Act requires national system employers to maintain extensive records in relation to:
•	basic employment details;
o	pay records;
•	hours worked;
•	leave entitlements;
•	superannuation contributions;
•	individual flexibility arrangement records;
•	guarantee of annual earnings;
•	termination of employment; and
•	transfer of business.

2.	Presentation of Records and Payslips
It is the responsibility of the employer to ensure that all records are in a legible form, in the English language and readily accessible to an inspector. An employer can provide an electronic pay slip to an employee provided it includes the same information as a hard copy of the pay slip. Further record keeping requirements may be specified in modern awards or enterprise agreements.

3.	What information should be included on a pay slip?
•	the employer's name;
•	the employer's ABN;
•	the employee's name;
•	the date of payment;
•	the dates of the pay period;
•	the gross and net payments;
•	any deductions to the gross payments;
•	superannuation contributions;
•	a record of all hours worked must be kept for casual and irregular part time employees who have a guaranteed basic rate of pay; and

 
•	Charrblr or Commtrce
andln<IUIITYWA
 
--	---  48
 
•	where an employee is entitled to be paid an incentive-based payment, a bonus, a loading, a penalty rate or another monetary allowance, the record must contain details of the payment.
In relation to hours worked, employers are required to keep the following records:
•	If an employee works overtime hours and a penalty rate or loading is applicable, the records to be kept are:
o	the number of overtime hours worked by the employee during the day; or
o	when the employee started and ceased working overtime hours.
•	If the employer and the employee agree in writing to average the employee's hours of work, it must be in accordance with the FW Act and any applicable modern award or enterprise agreement. The employer must also keep a copy of that agreement.
In relation to leave, the employer must keep records that specify:
•	any leave taken; and
•	the balance of the employee's entitlement to leave.
If any cashing out arrangements are made in writing between the employer and the employee, the employer must keep a copy of the written agreement and a record of the amount cashed out.
In relation to LSL, the employer must keep records that specify:
•	the employee's name, and if the employee is under twenty-one (21) years of age, the employee's date of birth;
•	the date the employee commenced employment with the employer;
•	the gross and net amounts paid to the employees including any deductions and the reason for those deductions;

•	details of any agreement between the employee and employer to contract out of LSL made under section 5 of the Long Service Leave Act 1958; and
•	each record must be retained during the employment of the employee and for not less than seven (7) years thereafter.
Family and Domestic Violence Leave - Pay Slip Reform
•	In relation to family and domestic violence leave, the Amendment Act 2022 implemented a new provision that provides for employees to retain their privacy in regard to the leave. The new provisions ensure the right to privacy by enabling paid family and domestic violence leave to be recorded as something other than the leave on an employee's pay slip. The Fair Work Regulations 2009 stipulate the must be reported on aChamber of commerce

pay slip as either ordinary time worked or as another kind of payment such as an allowance, bonus or a payment of overtime. Businesses can only class family and domestic violence leave as a period of leave (other than family and domestic violence leave) if it is at the employee's request.

SECTION SIX
Permitted Deductions

 
An employer cannot deduct amounts from an employee's wages without their c-onsent or clear lawful ability to do so.
The common deductions permitted by law include income tax and orders for child support made by the Family Court.
Other deductions are not permitted, such as imposing fines on an employee for breach of a policy or garnishing their wages due to a shortfall in their cash takings.
The FW Act permits deductions when they are authorised:
•	in writing by the employee and principally for the employee's benefit;
•	by the employee in accordance with an enterprise agreement;
•	by or under a modern award, a pre-modern award (federal award, NAPSA, or transitional award), or an order of the FWC; or
•	by or under a Commonwealth, State or Territory law or an order of a court.
Even if authorised, the deduction will not be permitted if it is directly or indirectly for the benefit of the employer and unreasonable in the circumstances, or if the employee is under the age of eighteen (18).

Unfair Dismissal
The following employees do not have access to protection of unfair dismissal laws:
•	if the employer is not a small business employer, an employee who is serving in the first six (6) months of employment;
•	if the employer is a small business employer, an employee who is serving in the first twelve (12) months of employment;
•	if an employee is earning more than $167,500 (figure correct as at 1 July 2023, indexed annually) per annum and is not covered by an award or enterprise agreement. This amount includes wages, agreed money value of non­ monetary benefits and non-statutory superannuation;
•	an employee who has been dismissed due to genuine redundancy;
•	an employee employed on a fixed term contract or training agreement whose employment ends by virtue of the fixed term contract or training arrangement; and
•	a casual employee who is not engaged on a regular and systematic basis. Unfair dismissal is deemed to have occurred if:
•	the employee was dismissed;
•	the dismissal was harsh, unjust, or unreasonable;
•	the dismissal was not a case of genuine redundancy; and
•	the dismissal was not consistent with the Small Business Fair Dismissal Code, where the employee was employed by a small business.
In considering whether it is satisfied that a dismissal was harsh, unjust, or unreasonable, the Fair Work Commission (FWC) must take into account the factors outlined in section 387 of the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) which include:
•	whether there was a valid reason for the dismissal related to the person's capacity or conduct (including its effect on the safety and welfare or other employees);
•	whether the person was notified of that reason;
•	whether the person was given an opportunity to respond to any reason related to the capacity or conduct of the person;
any unreasonable refusal by the employer to allow the person to have a support person present to assist at any discussions relating to dismissal;

•	Chall'. ro!Commerce
andlndustryWA
 
•	if the dismissal related to unsatisfactory performance by the person -whether the person had been warned about that unsatisfactory performance before the dismissal;
•	the degree to which the size of the employer's enterprise would be likely to impact on the procedures followed in effecting the dismissal;
•	the degree to which the absence of dedicated human resource management specialists or expertise in the enterprise would be likely to impact on the procedures followed in effecting the dismissal; and
•	any other matters that the FWC considers relevant.

1. Small Business Fair Dismissal Code
The Small Business Fair Dismissal Code (the Code) is intended to create special arrangements for small businesses with less than fifteen (15) employees. If, when terminating an employee, a small business has complied with the code, the termination should be deemed fair by the FWC.
The Code requires a simpler and shorter process to deal with an employee's poor performance prior to proceeding toward termination. The code only requires that the employee be warned verbally that they are at risk of being dismissed if there is no improvement in their performance. The employee must be afforded a chance to respond and a reasonable opportunity to improve.
An employer who is not a small business should ensure a more thorough process of performance management than a small business employer to minimise the risk of an unfair dismissal claim. It is important to ensure that procedural fairness has been afforded to an employee during the performance management procedure. Procedural fairness involves letting the employee know specifically what they are doing wrong, giving them a 'right of reply' and affording them a reasonable opportunity to rectify the problem.
Whilst some employees may not have protection of unfair dismissal and this may therefore simplify the procedure prior to the termination of an employee, it does not allow an employer an unrestricted right to terminate.
Employees who do not have the protection of unfair dismissal still have access to unlawful termination, discrimination, and to general protections claims. Employees may also take civil action against an employer for breach of contract.

2.	Avoiding unfair dismissal claims
Given the risks of claims for unlawful termination, discrimination and breach of contract, many employers will choose to follow a fair process when terminating an employee. Aside from a risk management approach, many employers also recognise the importance of building a strong relationship with employees based on mutual trust and respect. Employees will be more likely to work hard and be loyal to an employer if they know they and their co-workers will be treated fairly.
Employers often like to be regarded as 'employers of choice'. By following best practice, these employers will have a strategic advantage and potential employees will view them as favourable employers.
In addition, staff turnover can be costly. It makes financial sense to improve the performance of current employees rather than incur the cost of finding a replacement.
A fair procedure may include:
•	letting the employee know specifically what they are doing wrong and where improvement is necessary; and
•	giving the employee an opportunity to address these issues. If the employee's explanation is not acceptable:
•	advise the employee of what is expected and the consequences of failure; and
•	offer the employee assistance, such as training, counselling, mentoring, or coaching.
Follow the discussion with the employee with a letter outlining what was discussed at the meeting. Allow them the time and resources to fix the problem before deciding whether to terminate their employment.
Many employers will also want to set in place a Fair Treatment Process to ensure that employees have an avenue to follow if they feel they have been treated unfairly.

3.	Case study
Below is an unfair dismissal case that demonstrates the importance of a fair termination procedure under the Act.

Case Summary
FWC reinforces the need for HR to follow process
The Fair Work Commission has found an employer unfairly dismissed an employee who was caught on CClV footage urinating outside the entrance of a client's warehouse.
The Fair Work Commission (FWC) found the dismissal to be unfair due to lack of process that was afforded to the employee. The Commissioner found that there was a valid reason for dismissal, however the way in which the human resources dealt with the termination resulted in the dismissal being found to be unfair.
The delivery driver was caught on CClV footage urinating at the entrance of a client's warehouse during a delivery. The client subsequently banned the driver from their premises for the next three months and his employer did not have any other work available.
While the Commissioner found that there was a valid reason for dismissal, he criticised the way in which HR dealt with the process and found the dismissal to be unfair. The Commissioner commented that he was "satisfied that there was a valid
reason for the dismissal of the Applicant. The Respondent, however, made some
fundamental errors in the way it conducted the investigation and the way in which it reached its decision to terminate the Applicant's employment."
In particular, the Commissioner had found that:
•	during the course of the termination the employee was not given the allegations in writing, the conversations were had only over the phone;
•	the employee was not ever provided an opportunity to respond to the allegations;
•	the employee was not provided the opportunity to have a support person present due to the conversations being phone calls; and
•	concluded that given the size of the organisation the HR function should have the capability and resources to deal with the matter appropriately.
The Commissioner awarded the employee $16,128 less the net amount of payment received in lieu of notice.
This decision highlights the importance of for employers to ensure that they follow the correct processes during investigations and terminations. The Commissioner found that even though there was a valid reason for dismissal, due to the fact that the employee was not afforded the correct process by HR, the company had to pay the employee compensation for lost wages.

1.	Overview
Chapter 3 of the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) (FW Act) details general protections for employees and the rights and responsibilities of employees, employers, and organisations.
Under General Protections, the FW Act:
•	streamlines, consolidates and expands workplace protections, e.g. freedom of association, unlawful termination, sham contracting arrangements, coercion during bargaining and prohibitions relating to making false or misleading statements;
•	establishes 'workplace rights' broadly grouped as employment entitlements, and freedom to exercise and enforce those workplace rights;
•	expands employee protections by prohibiting any adverse action on discriminatory grounds including indirect or third-party actions;
•	allows the FWC to conduct conferences by agreement;
•	provides the courts with considerable powers to	deal with alleged contraventions; and
•	expands remedies for breaches, including penalties and compensation. There are several important provisions, as follows:
•	creation of a wide range of unlawful or "adverse actions" between employers and employees;
•	prospective employees have workplace rights;
•	workplace rights include: a benefit, role or responsibility, the initiation or participation in a process (or proceeding), or making a complaint or inquiry; and
•	workplace rights include protection against discrimination, whether direct or indirect, in relation to matters previously confined to the Federal and Western Australian Equal Opportunity Commissions.

2.	Onus of Proof
3.	Where a breach of General Protections is alleged, the onus lies on the employer to prove that it did not act for a particular reason or with the particular intent (that constitutes the contravention).Role of the FWC and Fair Work Ombudsman
The FWC can also deal with alleged contraventions of the general protection provisions. There are two (2) main types of applications:
Disputes- If a person has not been dismissed but alleges that there has been some other contravention of the general protections provisions, they may make an application to the FWC to deal with the dispute.
Dismissals - If a person believes they have been dismissed and alleges that their dismissal was in contravention of the general protections' provisions, they may make an application to the FWC to deal with the dismissal in the first instance. A general protections dismissal application must be lodged within 21 days of the dismissal taking effect.
The FWC can conduct a mediation conference by agreement between the parties. If the matter is not resolved, with the parties' agreement, the FWC can hear the matter. Alternatively, an application can be made to the Federal Court or to the Federal Circuit Court. The Court's powers include; issuing interim interlocutory injunctions and imposing penalties and ordering compensation.
The FWO is able to investigate allegations of discrimination in the workplace and start legal proceedings. The FWO can investigate allegations of contraventions of the general protection's provisions. Where identified, the FWO can initiate legal action for penalties of up to $18,780 for an individual or $93,900 for a corporation, per each identified and proved breach.

4.	What is the purpose of these general protections?
The Objects of Part 3-1 of the Act are:
•	to protect workplace rights;
•	to protect freedom of association;

to provide protection from workplace discrimination; and

-  62
 
•	to provide effective relief for those affected by any contraventions of the above.
[Section 336]

5.	Who do the general protections apply to?
This part of the Act applies to action taken by:
•	national system employers against national system employees;
•	national system employees that affects national system employer activities, functions, relationships or businesses;
•	a constitutionally covered entity against any person, even if the action is not taken against one of its employees;
•	any person to advise, incite, encourage or coerce a constitutionally covered entity to take action, whether or not the person who advises, etc or the person against whom the action would be taken, is one of its employees; and
any person that affects the activities, functions, relationships or business of a constitutionally covered entity.[Section 338]

6.	Workplace Rights
Adverse action in relation to person's workplace rights is prohibited. [Section 340]
Both employees and prospective employees have workplace rights, which include
circumstances where a person has:
•	an entitlement to a benefit; or
e	a role or responsibility; or
•	the ability to initiate, or participate in a process or proceeding; or
•	the ability to make an inquiry or complaint under a workplace law or instrument.
[Section 341]
The Amendment Act 2022 introduced two new wor·kplace rights (effective 6 December 2022);
•	the right to disclose/not disclose remuneration and any terms and conditions of employment necessary to determine remuneration outcomes; and
•	the right to ask any other employee their remuneration and any terms and conditions of employment necessary to determine remuneration outcomes.
[Section 333B]

Exceptions to the workplace rights include:
•	offers of employment to prospective employees that are conditional on the prospective employee accepting a guarantee of annual earnings; and
•	an employer refusing to employ an employee because the prospective employee is entitled to benefits under the transfer of business provisions.

[Section 341]

Illustrative example from the Explanatory Memorandum to the Act
Paul is employed as a shop assistant. To cope with the busy holiday trade, his employer has asked him to work overtime hours. However, Paul's take home pay does not appear to reflect the appropriate penalty rates under the award for the extra hours he has worked. His employer has ignored repeated requests to provide an explanation of how his pay has been calculated. Paul approaches his union and asks for their assistance to work out whether he is being paid the correct amount. Paul's union is a registered organisation and is entitled to represent his industrial interests. The employer finds out that he has sought the assistance of his union and dismisses him. Under section 341(1)(c)( i) of the Act, Paul has a workplace right because he has made an inquiry to the union about his entitlements under the award and the union is a person or body that can seek compliance with a workplace instrument (the award) under a workplace law.
Illustrative example from the Explanatory Memorandum to the Act
Freddy works part-time at a petrol station. He believes he is not being paid the correct award rate for a console operator. He writes a letter of complaint to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) as he mistakenly believes that it is able to investigate wage underpayments. Freddy tells his manager about the letter. Following this, his hours for the next fortnight are cut in half. Whilst the complaint would not be covered by section 341(1)(c)(i) of the Act as the ACCC does not have capacity under a workplace law to seek compliance with the applicable award, Freddy would still have exercised a workplace right because he has made a complaint regarding his employment (see section 341(1)(c)(ii)).

7.	Adverse Action
An employer, prospective employer or principal could take adverse action against an employee, potential employee or independent contractor. An employee, independent contractor or industrial association can also take adverse action against an employer, a person who has entered into a contract for services or a person.
Examples of adverse action between an employer and employee or prospective employee include, but are not limited to the following:
•	an employer dismissing an employee or altering an employee's position to the employee's disadvantage or discriminating between employees;
•	a prospective employer refusing to employ a prospective employee or discriminating against a prospective employee in the terms and conditions
offered to him/her; or
an employee ceasing work or taking industrial action against the employer.

"'-r Chamber or Commerce
andlndustryWA
 
[Section 342]
Adverse action does not include an employer standing down an employee who is engaged in protected industrial action and employed under a contract that makes provision to stand down an employee in the circumstances.
Actions taken by persons against others that amount to coercion, undue influence or misrepresentations are prohibited.

8.	Coercion
A person must not organise to take or threaten to take any action against another person with the intent to coerce the other person to:
•	exercise or not exercise a workplace right; or
•	exercise or propose to exercise a workplace right in a particular way. [Section 343]
9.	Undue Influence or Pressure
An employer must not exert undue influence or pressure on an employee in relation to a decision by the employee to:
•	make or not to make an agreement under the NES;
•	make or not to make an agreement under a term of a modern award or enterprise agreement;
•	agree to or terminate an individual flexibility arrangement;
•	accept a guarantee of annual earnings; and
•	agree, or not agree to a deduction from amounts payable to the employee in relation to the performance of work.
[Section 344]

1O. Misrepresentation
A person must not knowingly or recklessly make a false or misleading representation about:
•	the workplace rights of another person; or
the exercise or the effect of the exercise of a workplace right by another person.
(hamberofCcmmerce andlndu1tryW
 
[Section 345]
Breaches of the provisions prescribing coercion, undue influence or misrepresentations attract civil remedy provisions detailed in Part 4-1 of the Act.
11.	Industrial Activities
A Person must not take adverse action against another person because the other person is a member of an association or takes part, or does not take part, in industrial activity.
[section 346]
..,..,, Clarrber of tommene
andlndustrvWA
 
This division provides protection to persons who are or are not officers or members of an industrial association, or who engage in, or do not engage in, industrial activity. Essentially, it serves to preserve an individual's right to freedom of association.
Engaging in industrial activity is defined in great detail and includes but is not limited to, a person who does, or does not:
•	organise or promote a lawful activity for, or on behalf of an industrial association;
•	represent or advance views, claims or interests of an industrial association;
•	seek to be represented by an industrial association;

•	encourages or participates in, an unlawful activity organised or promoted by an industrial association; or
•	takes part in industrial action. [Section 347)
The Division also provides civil penalty provisions for persons who coerce, make misleading representations or otherwise provide inducement to a person to become, remain or cease to be a member of, an industrial association.
12.	Discrimination
An employer must not take adverse action against a person who is an employee, or prospective employee, of the employer because of the person's race, colour, sex, sexual orientation, breastfeeding, gender identity, intersex status, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family or carer's responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin.
Exceptions to the above include action that is:
•	not unlawful under State or Federal anti-discrimination law;

•	taken because of the inherent requirements of the position; or
•	taken against a staff member of an institution that is conducted in accordance with the doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings of a particular religion or creed.

13.	Other Protections
Temporary Absence - illness or injury
An employer must not dismiss an employee because the employee is temporarily absent from work because of illness or injury as prescribed by the regulations.
[Section 352]
The definition of "temporary absence" is contained in Regulation 3.01 of the Fair Work Regulations 2009.
Bargaining Service Fees
An industrial association or one of its officers or members must not demand or purport to demand payment of a bargaining services fee.
A bargaining services fee is a fee payable to an industrial association wholly or partly for the provision of bargaining services including the making, approval, operation, variation or termination of an enterprise agreement.
An exception to the above is for fees payable under a separate contract to provide such bargaining services.
[Section 353]
Coverage by particular instruments
A person must not discriminate against an employer because that employer's employees are covered or not covered by the NES, a particular type of workplace instrument or an enterprise agreement that does or does not cover an employee, organisation or a particular employee organisation or it is intended that the employees be so covered.
The above does not apply to protected industrial action [Section 354]
Coercion - allocation of duties
A person must not organise or take or threaten to organise or take any action against another person with the intent to coerce the other person or third person to:
•	employ or not employ a particular person;
•	engage or not engage a particular independent contractor;
•	allocate or not allocate particular duties or responsibilities to a particular employee or independent contractor; or
•	designate a particular employee or contractor as having or not having particular duties or responsibilities.
[Section 355]
 
Chambl!ro!Commerce andlndustryW

Sham Arrangements
An employer must not:
•	seek to employ individuals by misrepresenting the working relationship being proposed;
•	dismiss or threaten to dismiss an employee in order to engage that employee as an independent contractor to perform the same work; or
•	knowingly make false statements to influence an employee to enter into a contract for service under which s/he will perform the same work.
[Section 357-359]

14.	Minimising the risks associated with general protections provisions
In order to minimise the risks associated with a General Protections claim:
•	become familiar with the provisions outlined in the NES;

•	review employment contracts and agreements to ensure they take into account any changes that occurred with the implementation of the NES;
•	establish a formal grievance policy which clearly outlines the steps taken by the employer to address the employees' grievances, therefore enabling employers to effectively respond to employee concerns;
•	ensure that all current policies and procedures do not contain any provisions that may be viewed as discriminatory; and
•	follow correct procedure and maintain records when taking disciplinary action.
Review performance management processes
Employers will need to protect themselves from adverse action claims which could stem from outdated or poorly handled performance management processes. Overlooking these processes could expose employers to a multitude of legal pitfalls.
Accordingly, employers should take the time to audit their current practices, identifying any weak areas in order to mitigate risks of claims being brought against them in the future
In reviewing performance management processes, employers should consider the following areas:
•	Communication: What are the expectations of performance? Have these been clearly articulated to employees? Are they documented? Have employees been verbally warned that their performance is substandard?

ChamlH!rof(oml!lerce
andlnd111tryWA
 
•	Written warnings: How many should be given to employees? Do they clearly express that failure to show improvement, may lead to termination of employment?
•	Time frames: Have employees been given an opportunity to respond to issues regarding performance? Does the process give a reasonable period of time to demonstrate improvement? It is important to note that what might be deemed to be reasonable in one situation may differ in another, so it is important to treat each situation on a case by case basis.
•	Training: Is the provision of additional training or assistance feasible? Will it afford the employee a genuine opportunity to improve their performance?
By developing processes that are sensible and reasonable, employers can reduce the potential of claims being made and enhance the ability to defend a termination decision should a claim be brought against them.
Educating Managers
As many of the decisions that may constitute adverse action are made by managers, it is suggested that supervisors and managers are educated on the following topics:
•	The FW Act with a focus on:
o	The NES (to avoid inadvertently breaching the provisions because the employer is unaware of workplace rights. By way of example, misrepresenting an employee's right to carers leave by advising an employee that they are unable to take their personal leave to care for a sick child); and
o	the employee's entitlements under an applicable award or agreement.
•	General Protections and the risks associated with the reverse onus of proof. As part of this training a focus should be given to:
•	Decision Making
a.	employees' workplace rights are considered when making decisions; and
b.	there is a good procedure followed when making decisions so that a claim can be defended. Specifically:
o   Transparency. Is it obvious to relevant parties how and why they came to the decision? (When employees do not know why a decision was made, they are more likely to jump to the wrong conclusions - e.g., I did not get the promotion because I am having a baby).
0		justifiability. Can the employer back up with evidence why they made a particular decision? Does the employer have objective selection criteria documented for important decisions?

•	Chamb!!r of Commerce
andlndusll'yWA
 
o	Consistency.  Is the decision in line with past practice? If not, can this be justified?
o	Fairness.  Is the decision fair? (Although the General Protections section of the Act does not specify that decisions need to be fair), decisions perceived as being unfair are more likely to be challenged by an employee.
0		Documentation. Has the employer produced and kept paperwork as a record of how it came to a particular decision? This can include spreadsheets, emails and notes.
•	Performance Management & Termination - with a focus on carrying out a fair procedure and may include the following:
o	carrying out a proper & thorough investigation of incidents/allegations;
o	giving employees an opportunity to respond to any allegations;
o	giving written warnings and the opportunity to improve before terminating; and
o	ensuring workplace rights are not taken into account when deciding to performance manage or terminate (e.g., giving an employee a warning for their behaviour when they were acting in an official capacity as a union representative).

15.	Case studies


•	Clamtmorcommer<e andlnd111tryWA
 
Resources Manager refused to allow the employee to be represented during the meeting and insisted the union representative sign an internal company form limiting his role to that of an observer. When the employee insisted on being represented, the Human Resources Manager ended the meeting and threatened to call the police unless the union representative left the premises.
A further meeting occurred the following day and the employee was again accompanied by the union representative. After refusing the presence of the union representative again, the meeting broke down for a second time.
Eleven (11) days later, the employee returned to work and was issued a termination letter citing the unauthorised overtime issue as the reason for termination. The letter stated that although the company had originally intended to only demote the employee, his lack of co-operation in the disciplinary meetings lead to the decision to terminate his employment.
Federal Magistrate Lloyd Jones found the decision to dismiss the employee was a
"...direct result of his insistence on having his union representative present at the disciplinary meeting..." and this constituted a 'prohibited reason' under section 792 of the Act. The Federal Magistrate held that the Human Resources Manager had undermined the employee's right to be represented by a union and her behaviour appeared to reflect her lack of ability and competence as Human Resources
professional.
Despite the finding in favour of the employee, no penalties were ordered. The Federal Magistrate ordered the parties to confer on the issues of compensation and reinstatement and where no agreement could be reached, each of the parties were to provide him with written submissions in respect to those issues. After considering written submissions from the parties, the Federal Magistrate ordered reinstatement, an $11,000 penalty and $15,810.73 in compensation to the employee.
Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones observed the court "...Unfortunately sees too many instances similar to the matters in this case... that are inappropriately and incompetently approached by persons who parade under the banner of Human Resources Specialists".
This decision highlights the importance of all human resources staff being familiar with the legislation and further, equipped with the skills and abilities to identify and resolve workplace issues in a competent manner.

same decision also confirmed that employees who exercised a workplace right prior to the commencement of the Act are still able to make a general protections claim.
Mr Puspitono was a licensed aircraft mechanical engineer employed by International Aviation Service Assistance Pty Ltd (IASA) under a visa. He made an adverse action claim against IASA following the termination of his employment in September 2009. Mr Puspitono's employment history with IASA had been somewhat tumultuous following a complaint he made about overtime payments. When Mr Puspitono became aware that he was being underpaid, he complained on behalf of himself and another employee to the senior management of IASA. Soon after the complaint was made, both employees were notified that the payments would be corrected in the future.
Shortly thereafter, Mr Puspitono was requested to work overtime as a maintenance check he was required to perform had been rescheduled. When Mr Puspitono asked his supervisor whether overtime payments would be made, the supervisor advised that they would not and his "hands were tied". In response, Mr Puspitono left work without performing his required duties and was suspended from his job on full pay while an investigation was pending. Mr Puspitono sought assistance from The Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association (the Union) to act on his behalf.
The national secretary of the Union called the management of IASA only to be told that the Union's assistance was not needed and if the Union persisted, IASA would terminate Mr Puspitono without notice. IASA later conceded and recognised the employee's right to be represented by the Union. A week later, the outstanding overtime payments were made.
In May 2009, Mr Puspitono was made redundant. The Union made an application to the AIRC claiming that the termination was harsh, unjust or unreasonable on the grounds of discrimination by reason of his trade union membership. The Union also lodged an application in the Federal Court seeking a declaration that the termination was performed for a prohibited reason under the WR Act and sought interlocutory relief. Mr Puspitono was successfully reinstated and returned to work on 24 July 2009. In September 2009, IASA underwent the process of lodging new authorisations with Garuda for its licensed aircraft mechanical engineers. In Mr Puspitono's authorisation, he was assessed as 'unsatisfactory' in two categories by IASA management and his re­ authorisation was refused. IASA advised Mr Puspitono that it was a condition of his employment that he held an appropriate authorisation and because of the refusal, he would again be made redundant. As Mr Puspitono was employed under a visa, he was forced to leave Australia with his family following his termination.
On behalf of Mr Puspitono, the Union lodged a general protections claim. At hearing, Justice Barker found that the actions of IASA had constituted adverse action against the employee. In particular, he noted that making a negative assessment and sending it to Garuda made Mr Puspitono's employment insecure and adversely effected his position as an employee contrary to section 342(1)(c) of the Act. It was also held that IASA had taken adverse action against Mr Puspitono for exercising his workplace right

1.	What is Equal Employment Opportunity?
Equal Opportunity in employment means that employees are judged on their ability to do the job based on merit rather than assumptions about them based on different characteristics.
Discrimination in employment is any distinction, exclusion or preference that has the effect of nullifying or impairing equality of opportunity or treatment in employment.
2.	Direct Discrimination
Direct discrimination occurs where a person distinguishes between individuals or groups because of a characteristic that applies, or is assumed to apply, to that individual or group, so as to disadvantage some and advantage others.
This is probably the most familiar form of discrimination as it is the most recognisable. Examples:
•	'you don't get the job because you're black'
•	'you get retrenched first because you are a woman'
More formally, direct discrimination can be regarded as the outcome of unfavourable and unfair treatment based upon:
a.	a person's membership (including perceived or imputed membership) of a certain group such as age or sex
b.	stereo-typed beliefs about the behaviours and capacities of that group.

3.	Indirect Discrimination
This form of discrimination is more subtle and much less widely understood. It is said to occur where one person appears to be treated just as another is or would be treated but the impact of such 'equal treatment' is that the person is in fact treated less favourably.
Indirect discrimination occurs when there is a requirement that appears to apply equally to all, but which has an adverse effect or result on a particular group and which is not reasonable having regard to the circumstances.
For example, where there is a rule, policy or procedure that is the same for everyone, but which has an unequal or disproportionate effect or result on particular groups. Unless this requirement is 'reasonable' having regard to the circumstances', it is likely to be indirect discrimination - even if there was never any intention to discriminate.
Examples:CMmberorCommerce
andlnd111lr1WA	78
 
•	A company which has a last-on-first-off policy during retrenchment of trades staff indirectly discriminates against women because women have only recently been employed in those areas.
•	An organisation requiring applicants for all positions to complete a 3 page application form indirectly discriminates against people who do not have well developed communication skills or for whom English is a second language and where such skills are not relevant to the position e.g. packing work.
Exemptions and Special Measures
Examples:
•	Genuine occupational qualification - the person must be able to carry out the essential or inherent requirements of the job e.g. employment of a male actor to play a male character in a film or play;
•	Standards of decency - e.g. employing only female assistants in a women's clothing store which requires assisting women in a state of undress;
" Measures intended to achieve equality e.g. a company may specifically advertise for female apprentices or provide management training for female employees, in recognition that in the past, women were discriminated against in these areas and hence, their participation is low.
•	Unjustifiable hardship - it is lawful to discriminate against a person with special needs if the special services and/or facilities that are required would be an unjustifiable hardship to provide. Not only the cost of providing special services is looked at but the ability of the employer to meet costs as well as the benefits and detriments to all parities.
4.	Sexual and Sex-Based Harassment
Employers have a positive duty to take all reasonable and proportionate steps to eliminate unlawful conduct within the workplace. Employers may be liable for any sexual or sex-based harassment their employees commit or are subjected to or subjecting another person to a hostile workplace environment.
If a complaint lodged with the Equal Opportunity Commission is successful, the employer can be ordered to pay an unlimited amount under federal legislation.
Claims can be made under State or federal legislation.
Employers can reduce or eliminate their liability for sexual and sex-based harassment by fulfilling the following obligations:

ciam ror Commerce
andlnduslryWA
 
•	Develop a company Sexual Harassment Policy and communicate it to all employees (including new employees when they commence). The employer should identify what constitutes sexual harassment and emphasise that it will not be tolerated and may lead to termination.
•	Develop an effective Complaint Procedure and communicate it to all employees.
•	Follow set procedures in the event of a complaint.
Sexual harassment is included in the definition of serious misconduct for the purposes of the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth).
What constitutes sexual harassment?

The legal definition of sexual harassment varies between State and federal jurisdictions. Two common elements specify behaviour must be:
•	of a sexual nature
•	unwelcome
Under the federal legislation the third element requires that a reasonable person would have anticipated the possibility that the person harassed would regard the behaviour as offensive, humiliating or intimidating.
Under State legislation, the third element requires that the person at whom the behaviour is directed has reasonable grounds for believing rejection of the behaviour would disadvantage their employment prospects or is in any way connected with their employment.
Behaviour that may constitute sexual harassment is outlined below:

•	physical contact such as patting, rubbing and massaging
.,	suggestive comments about a person's appearance
.,	sending sexually oriented e-mail

•	sexually graphic posters, calendars and messages left on desks and computer screens
•	inferences about a person's sexual morality
•	gestures or movements of a sexual nature
.,	repeated requests for dates or drinks

Humour or friendship based on mutual consent is not sexual harassment. The conduct must be unwelcome.

It is not the intention behind the behaviour that matters but the feelings of the person at whom the behaviour is directed.
The conduct does not have to be repeated or continuous to be classed as harassment. A single act can amount to sexual harassment.
What constitutes sex-based harassment?
As per the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth), sex-based harassment is described as:
•	unwelcome conduct of a seriously demeaning nature by reason of the person's sex, in circumstances in which a reasonable person would have anticipated the possibility that the person harassed wouId be offended, humiliated or intimidated.
Individuals claiming sex-based harassment has occurred must establish that there is a relationship of employment, or agency, and that the alleged unlawful conduct occurred in connect with their employment.
In relation to the above, in determining if sex-based harassment has occurred, circumstances the Fair Work Commission will take into account include, but are not limited to:
•	the sex, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status, marital or relationship status, religious belief, race, colour, or national or ethnic origin, of the person harassed;
•	the relationship between the person harassed and the person who engaged in the conduct;
•	any disability of the person harassed;
•	any power imbalance in the relationship between the person harassed and the person who engaged in the conduct;
•	the seriousness of the conduct;
•	whether the conduct has been repeated; and
•	any other relevant circumstance.
Anti-Sexual Harassment Order - FWC
The FWC has powers to make an order to stop sexual harassment. These orders operate similarly to stop-bullying orders, with the FWC able to make any order it considers appropriate (except for requiring payment of a pecuniary amount/compensation.
Prohibiting sexual harassment in connection with work
The Amendment Act 2022 introduced the prohibition of sexual harassment in connect with work into the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth). The prohibition applies where the sexual harassment occurred, or is part of a course of conduct that commenced, on or after 6

March 2023. Employees can now apply to the Fair Work Commission to deal with a sexual harassment dispute within 2 years of the last alleged prohibited conduct.
Respect at Work
In 2018, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner under·took a national inquiry into sexual harassment in Australian workplaces, resulting in the Respect@Work report being published in 2020. The Respect@Work report outlined 55 recommendations for the Government to implement in regards to improving how workplaces prevent and respond to sexual harassment.
In June 2021, the Coalition Government introduced the Sex Discrimination and Fair Work (Respect at Work) Amendment Act 2021 (Respect@Work Act 2021), adopting 6 of the legislative recommendations from the report. The Respect@Work Act 2021 introduced;
•	sexual harassment as a valid reason for dismissal;
•	sexual harassment within the meaning of serious misconduct;
•	stop sexual harassment orders;

•	miscarriage as a circumstance an employee can access compassionate leave;
•	sex-based harassment;
•	changes to the object, coverage and scope of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) (SO Act);
•	an expanded definition of victimisation in the SD Act; and
•	more onus on individuals in regard to accessory and vicarious liability.
In December 2022, the Labor Government introduced the Anti-Discrimination and Human Rights Legislation Amendment (Respect at Work) Act 2022 (Respect@Work Act 2022), which implemented the remainder of the legislative recommendations from the Respect@Work report. The Respect@Work Act 2022 amended human rights and discrimination legislation to introduce:
•	the prohibition of hostile workplace environments on the grounds of sex;
•	a positive duty for employers to take reasonable and proportionate measures to eliminate unlawful discrimination as far as possible; and
•	new compliance powers for the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC).
The amendments further tightened the legal and regulatory frameworks in Australia in relation to sex discrimination, expanding employers' duties to workers in a discrimination context.

Helpful Resources
The full Respect at Work report can be found here.
To assist and support employers with the new compliance provisions, the Australian Human Rights Commission has created a Respect@Work portal which can be found here: www.respectatwork.gov.au. The portal contains best-practice guides, training programs, workplace-assessment tools, information and videos in relation to sex discrimination.
Additionally, CCIWA has developed a new public training course, 'Dealing with Difficult Workplace Behaviours - Bullying and Sexual Harassment'. This course assists employers with understanding the relevant legal framework, promoting positive workplace culture (proactive steps) and appropriately managing complaints, register today: www.cciwa.com/events-learning/training-courses/.
5.	Vicarious and Accessorial Liability
Vicarious liability
An employer may be vicariously liable where discrimination or harassment occurs in connection with a worker's employment or duties.
Accessorial liability
An employer may be accessory liable where its considered they were responsible for discrimination or harassment that occurred in the workplace between employees.
Reducing liability
An employer may be able to reduce liability if it can be demonstrated that all reasonable steps were taken to prevent the discrimination from occurring.
Reasonable steps could include:
•	Developing and implementing an Equal Opportunity Policy;
•	Establishing and following an effective complaints procedure;
•	Providing relevant training in awareness of Equal Opportunity issues.

6.	Workplace Bullying
The anti-bullying provisions of the Fair Work Act 2009 (FW Act) provide that a worker (which can also include independent contractors, employees of contractors, and volunteers) who reasonably believes they have been bullied at work may make an application to the Fair Work Commission (FWC) for an order to stop the bullying.
Bullying occurs where an individual or group of individuals repeatedly behaves unreasonably towards a worker(s) and that behaviour creates a risk to health and safety.

 
Chambero!Commerce andIndustry WA
 
 	----- 83
 
However, the FW Act limits and qualifies the operation of the workplace bullying provisions in relation to the defence force, Australia's security agencies and the Australian Federal Police.
Where an application is made the FWC must commence deal1ing with the matter (e.g. inform itself of the matter, conduct a conference or hold a hearing) within 14 days.
If the FWC is satisfied that the worker has been bullied at work; and there is a risk the worker will continue to be bullied, the FWC may make any order it considers appropriate to prevent the worker from being bullied at work by the individual or group.
The power of the FWC to grant an order is limited to preventing the worker from being bullied at work, and the focus is on resolving the matter and enabling normal working relationships to resume. As a result, the FWC is not permitted to make an order requiring the payment of a pecuniary amount/compensation or ordering reinstatement.
The options available to the FWC can include:

•	that the individual or group of individuals must stop the specified behaviour;
•	regular monitoring of behaviours by an employer;

•	compliance with an employer's workplace bullying policy;
•	the provision of information and additional support and training to workers; or
review of the employer's workplace bullying policy.

Enterprise Agreement
Termination of enterprise agreements
An enterprise agreement will continue to operate past its nominal expiry date until it is either terminated or replaced. The amendments to the FW Act have outlined the conditions the FWC must consider when an application to terminate an enterprise agreement is received. One of the following considerations must apply for the agreement to be terminated:
•	The continued operation would be unfair to those employees covered by the agreement
•	The agreement does not and is not likely to cover any employees
•	The agreement poses a significant threat to the viability of the business, and the termination of the agreement would reduce the number of potential employee terminations covered by the agreement, and the employer has entered into a guarantee of termination entitlements for those employees covered by the agreement
The FWC must be satisfied the termination of the agreement is appropriate in all the circumstances. It also needs to consider the views of the employees, each employer and each employee organisation (if any) or employers and;

 
•	ChamberolCommerce
andlnduslryWA
 
-	89
 
•	whether the application was made at or after the notification time for a proposed enterprise agreement that will cover the same, or substantially the same, group of employees as the existing agreement; and
•	whether bargaining for the proposed enterprise agreement is occurring; and
•	whether the termination of the existing agreement would adversely affect the bargaining position of the employees that will be covered by the proposed enterprise agreement.
Any other relevant matters may also be considered by the FWC.
Sec. 226 of the FW Act
Effective: 7 December 2022

Sunsetting of pre-reform agreements
Enterprise agreements that were formed prior to the FW Act will cease operation. These agreements include agreement-based transitional instruments enterprise agreements made between 1 July 2009 and 31 December 2009.
Employers are required to provide employees written notice prior to 7June 2023 outlining the agreement will terminate on 7 December 2023 unless an extension application is lodged with the FWC prior to the termination date. There are certain criteria that needs to be met for an extension to be granted.
Sec. 20A of the FW Act
Effective: 7 December 2023

Enterprise agreement approval
Prior to asking employees to vote on a proposed multi-enterprise agreement, the employer must obtain written approval from the relevant employee organisations involved in the bargaining process. Where an employee organisation is unreasonably withholding approval, the employer may apply to the FWC for a voting request order.
Sec. 180A of the FW Act
In the FWC approval process, the employer is required to submit a statement of principles that outlines the agreement has genuinely been agreed to by the employees covered by the agreement. The FWC will take into consideration if the employees covered by the agreement have been sufficiently represented and the terms contained the agreement have sufficient interest in the agreement terms.
Sec. 188 of the FW Act
Effective: 6 June 2023
Chamber orCommene aodlndustryWA
 
Initiating bargaining
A bargaining representative of an employee of a proposed agreement may issue an employer a written request to commence bargaining provided:

•	A single interest employer authorisation did not cease to be in operation because of the making of the earlier agreement; and
•	No more than 5 years has passed since the nominal expiry date; and
The proposed agreement will cover the same or substantially the same employees as the previous agreement.
Sec. 173(2A) of the FW Act

namber or Commeice
andlndusb'yWA
 
The FWC can make an intractable bargaining declaration related to a proposed enterprise agreement when the applicant participated in conciliation/arbitration and there is no reasonable prospect of agreement being reached if the FWC does not make the declaration and it is reasonable.

•	if there are clearly identifiable common interests in the employers
•	the likely number of bargaining representatives and if it would be manageable
•	and at least some of the employees to be covered are represented by an organisation.

Sec. 243A of the FW Act
Effective: 6 June 2023

Single interest employer authorisations"6,r Chamber or Commerce
andlndustryWA	92
 
A single interest employer agreement is an enterprise agreement between two or more employers who have a common interest.
The employees or their representative or the employer can apply for authorisation as long as the FWC is satisfied that:
•	some of the employees to be covered by this agreement are represented
•	the operations and business of each employer is reasonably comparable
•	and the employer employs more than 50 employees.
It can be granted as long as there are common interests in the employer's geographical location, regulatory regime, or nature of enterprise.
If over 50 employees are employed, there is a presumption on this application that there is a common interest.
There are safeguards in place for those employing more than 20 but less than 50 employees.
The majority of the employees in each business must be in favour of the single interest employer authorisation, however FWC can use any method it considers appropriate to determine whether there is a majority or not.
Sec. 248-249 of the FW Act This will not apply to employees in relation to 'general building and construction work'.
Sec. 249A of the FW Act
The FWC has discretion to not make the authorisation regarding an employer if the employers are bargaining in good faith for an enterprise agreement already, have a history of effective bargaining and less than 9 months have passed since the most recent expiry date of their enterprise agreement.
Sec. 250 of the FW Act
Effective: 6 June 2023

Varying enterprise agreements to add employers and their employees
Employers and employees with 20 or more employees can be added to a single interest employer agreement. The application can either be made jointly between the employer and the employees, or by an employee organisation. If an application is made by an employee organisation, and the employer has 50 or more employees, then it will be presumed that the business activities are reasonably comparable to the other businesses covered by the agreement, unless the contrary is proved.
The FWC must also be satisfied that where an employee organisation makes the application, a majority of the affected employees want to be covered by the agreement.

Employees may request an extension of unpaid parental leave for a further 12months. Employers need to respond to an employees request in writing within 21 days and highlight whether the extension is granted or declined and the details of the extension,
i.e. the period of leave etc.
An employer may only decline a parental leave extension request where they have:
•	Discussed the request with the employee;
•	Genuinely attempted to reach an agreement;
•	Taken into consideration the impact to the employee; and
•	Reasonable business grounds.
In instances where the employer declines the request, the written response also needs to include detailed reasons for the decline.
Sec. 76A of the FW Act
Similar to the flexible work arrangement provisions, the powers of the FWC have been expanded to deal with disputes regarding parental leave extensions where the employer and employee have been unable to resolve it at a workplace level. Whilst the FWC have the ability to arbitrate the matter, they may only do so after other means have been unsuccessful (unless there is exceptional circumstances).
Sec. 768 to 76C of the FW Act
Effective: 6 June 2023
On 22 June 2023, the Australian Government passed the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Protecting Worker Entitlements) Act 2023. The changes have resulted in the removal of restrictions to parents taking unpaid parental leave concurrently, which was previously capped at a maximum of 8 weeks. The terminology 'employee couple' no longer applies to unpaid parental leave, with parents able to both make use of up to 12 months unpaid parental leave, with no impact to the other parent's leave entitlement.

H-HRM-POL-027              REV DATE: 18-10-2021


Travel
Policy
The travel policy provides the guidelines to support the most effective journey management plans.
Travel Components

Accommodation
Where an employee is required to stay overnight away from their point of hire (i.e. no connecting flight, training or they are required in an office away from their point of hire) the company will arrange & pay for suitable accommodation. The company reserves the right to select appropriate accommodation based on the specific requirements.

Meal Allowance
Where an employee is required to stay overnight away from their point of hire or site, the Company will reimburse meal expenses up to a value of $35 per night spent away subject to the provision of relevant receipts and excluding any alcohol consumption.

Transport
To/From Airport

Suitable transportation will be arranged by the company between the project airport and the camp/site. For site based employees, transport from home airport to residence (e.g. taxi’s and fees incurred for vehicle parking) is to be arranged by, and at the cost of, the employee.

Where possible a vehicle will be provided to non-site based employees. Where this is not possible the employee will be able to claim reimbursement for km’s travelled in their personal vehicle as per the Motor Vehicle Policy. The company will reimburse the employee for parking fees, or where more cost effective the General Manager may authorise the use of a return taxi service.

To/From Function

It is the responsibility of the employee to arrange transport to/from an authorised business function or social event unless the Managing Director approves the use of a taxi service.

For Overnight Stay

Where an employee is required to stay away from their point of hire at the request/direction of the company, the company will arrange & pay for the necessary transportation (e.g. taxi, car hire, fuel and parking fees). An example of this is where an employee is required to stay overnight in a capital city because they have missed a connecting flight to return to their point of hire for circumstances beyond their control.

H-HRM-POL-029              REV DATE: 18-10-2021



 

Flights To & From Site
The most effective and commercially sound journey management plan shall always be adopted. This will generally mean that flights to site will largely be the first morning flight and flights from site will largely be last afternoon or evening flight. Project Managers have the authority to approve alternative arrangements in specific circumstances where due to safety concerns (i.e. client or Company fatigue management plans require otherwise) or commercial reasons (i.e. unreasonably high connecting flight costs) it becomes more effective for the Company to arrange an earlier flight out from site or a later flight to site. In these individual cases the Project Manager should seek guidance from their Manager prior to authorising.

Journey management plans shall be regularly reviewed to ensure they continue to be the most effective and commercially sound.

Employee Late Flight Cancellation and Missed Flights
Employees must inform site as soon as practical upon becoming aware that they need to cancel (or have missed) their flight.

The Discipline and Termination Management Procedure will apply. Typically, unjustified missed flights and late cancellations will result into a formal written warning. Further unjustified missed flights and late cancellations may result in dismissal.

Employees who miss their flights will be charged applicable fare costs. Where an employee believes there are extenuating circumstances for missing the flight, the Company will assess each case on its merits.

Where a client introduces a site policy regulating flight cancellations and no shows, its terms will be adopted in conjunction with this policy and will prevail should the terms be conflicting. Appropriate communication will be carried out to ensure all relevant employees understand the specific terms.

 

H-HRM-POL-029              REV DATE: 18-10-2021


Leave
Policy
We are committed to managing leave in accordance with all legislative requirements. This policy describes the most frequent leave types and is administered in accordance with the leave support procedure.
Types of Leave

All types of leave must be approved by the appropriate General Manager.

 

Annual Leave
Annual Leave accrues progressively during a year of service to 20 days (pro-rata) per year according to the ordinary hours of work, accumulating from year to year. Any annual leave in excess of 4 weeks can be paid out at the request of the employee.

Annual leave shall be taken Monday to Friday only, excluding public holidays. It cannot be taken in advance unless it is unpaid. FIFO employees shall plan their leave in alignment with roster requirements, ensuring leave is taken at the beginning or end of each cycle in order to minimise operational impact and flight costs. An annual leave request may be refused if it poses significant hindrance on operational requirements.

In order to meet operational requirements the Company may require an employee to take a period of annual leave during shut down periods (e.g. Christmas), or in such cases where the employee is deemed to have accrued an excessive amount of leave.

 

Personal/Carer’s Leave
An employee may take paid personal/carer’s leave:

·        If they are unfit for work because of their own personal illness or injury; or

·        To provide care or support to a member of their immediate family or household, because of a personal illness, injury or unexpected emergency affecting the member.

This type of leave accrues progressively through the year of service to 10 days (pro-rata) per year. It is paid at base salary, plus any applicable allowances based on ordinary hours of work.

The employee shall inform their manager as soon as practical of their absence and must advise of their expected period of absence based on their circumstances. The employee shall provide their manager with evidence that their absence meets the criteria for this type of leave (ie. a Medical Certificate or Statutory Declaration).

H-HRM-POL-030                                  REV DATE: 18-10-2021


Compassionate Leave
An employee is entitled to 2 days (pro-rata) a year of compassionate leave, to spend time with a member of their immediate family or household who has sustained a life-threatening illness or injury, or in the case of their death. This leave will be paid in accordance with the employee’s base salary.

 

Paid Parental Leave
Paid Parental Leave may be available to an employee who meets the following criteria:

·        Has been engaged in work continuously for at least 10 of the 13 months prior to the birth or adoption of the child, and;

·        Worked at least 330 hours in the ten month period (an average of 1 day/wk)

·        Adjusted taxable income of $150,000 or less in the financial period prior to the birth

·        Is a Permanent Australian Resident

This leave will be paid by the company on behalf of the Family Assistance Office at the National Minimum Wage for a continuous 18 week period.

 

Unpaid Parental Leave
An employee is eligible to unpaid parental leave for a period of up to 12 months, provided they have completed at least 12 months of continuous service with within the group. This may be extended upon a written request at least 4 weeks prior to their scheduled return date, for up to 24 months in total for an individual, or 24 months as a combined total between an employee couple.

Following a period of unpaid parental leave an employee is guaranteed the prospect to return to work in either their previous position or if that position no longer exists, an available position for which they are qualified and suited.

 

Long Service Leave
Long Service Leave accrues progressively to 8⅔ weeks for 10 years of continuous service and will be paid at base salary. Although Long Service Leave cannot be taken earlier it will be paid pro-rata to an employee who terminates after 7 years of continuous service.

 

Community Service Leave
Community service leave is for the purpose of performing activities such as a ‘voluntary emergency management activity’ or jury service (including attendance for jury selection). Community service leave is unpaid, with the exception of leave for the purpose of jury service. In this instance the employee will receive jury service pay for the first 10 days of service and the company will provide any additional payments to ensure the employee receives their ordinary base salary. Where the company requests evidence of the community service conducted, payment may be withheld until this is provided.

Roster
Policy
The company often operates in geographically dispersed and remote areas on a fly-in/fly-out basis with a number of different rosters. Rosters are managed in accordance with the principles below and administered with the terms and conditions described in the rosters management procedure.
·        Rosters are established at the discretion of the Company

·        Rosters vary from project to project

·        Rest and Recreation (R&R) is applicable only to those employees that work on a regular Fly-In/Fly-Out roster

·        R&R is accrued pro-rata for the time physically spent on site based on the applicable roster. For example, on a 3 & 1 roster employees will accrue .33 days R&R for each day spent on site. On a 15 & 6 roster employees will accrue .4 days R&R for each day spent on site

·        R&R is only accrued whilst physically on site, including sick days

·        R&R eligibility is rounded to the closest full day over the applicable rotation

·        Accrued R&R must be fully exhausted before any leave is authorised. For example:

o   Where an employee is away from site for the last 5 days of the cycle on a 15 & 6 roster then they shall use the accrued R&R for the 10 days spent on site (4 days in this example) plus any previously accrued R&R before they can take annual leave. Then they shall commence the 6 days R&R as per their roster

o   If an employee on a 3 & 1 roster wants to return 3 days late from R&R, they shall take any accrued R&R prior to any annual leave being accessed for those three days

o   If an employee has returned 5 days late to site on a 15/6 roster, they will only accrue 4 days R&R for that rotation. However they will be required to take 6 days R&R to align with site rosters. Where the employee does not have any previously accrued R&R, they will be required to take 2 days annual leave to meet operational requirements. Where the employee has no annual leave left, they shall take unpaid annual leave

o   R&R is not portable from project to project. In exceptional circumstances, R&R might be portable to meet a critical operational requirement. In these circumstances accrued R&R will be costed to the receiving site and must be approved by the receiving GM

o   R&R is paid at the base rate of pay plus applicable site allowance.

SECTION 5: LEAVE PROVISIONS
31	ANNUAL LEAVE
31.1	Employees are entitled to annual leave in accordance with the Act, as amended from time to time. A summary of the entitlement to annual leave as at the date of this Agreement is as follows:
a)	Employees (except casual Employees) will accrue four (4) weeks annual leave per year; pro-rata for part-time Employees; and
b)	Leave may be taken at times mutually agreed between the Company and an Employee.
31.2	Subject to clauses 31.4 and 31.5, Employees will accrue annual leave based on their Ordinary Hours of work and will be paid at the Ordinary Time Rate for their Ordinary Hours that would otherwise have been worked in the period of absence.

31.6	The applicable leave loading mentioned in clauses 31.4 and 31.5 is payable for the loss of opportunity to work overtime, whilst being on leave. Therefore, leave loading is not ordinary time earnings for the purpose of superannuation and accordingly, superannuation will not be payable on leave loading.

a)	their remaining accrued leave entitlement will not be less than four (4) weeks;

31.9	If an Employee’s employment ceases, they will be paid any accrued annual leave.

Employees are required to align periods of approved annual or long service leave with rostered R&R flights in all instances. Failure to do so will result in travel for the period of approved leave being at the Employee's cost.
31.12	For the purposes of annual leave under the NES, a shift worker means:
a)	an Employee engaged to work in a system of consecutive shifts throughout the 24 hours of each of at least six (6) consecutive days without interruption (except during breakdown or meal breaks or due to unavoidable causes beyond the control of the Company) and who is regularly rostered to work those shifts;

41.4	Where Inclement Weather has been declared and a concrete pour has already been commenced, Employees may be required to complete such concrete pour where it is safe to do so, to a stage of practical completion and in the case of wet weather shall be provided with adequate wet weather gear.

In this case, such work will be paid at the rate of double the Ordinary Time Rate calculated to the next hour. Where more than one allowance or penalty rate may apply to the Ordinary Time Rate, only one, being the highest applicable, will apply.
