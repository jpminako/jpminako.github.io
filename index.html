31.2 Subject to clauses 31.4 and 31.5, Employees will accrue annual leave based on their Ordinary Hours of work (which does not include overtime) and will be paid at the All-purpose Rate of Pay for their Ordinary Hours that would otherwise have been worked in the period of absence.

    c) the Employee is paid at least the full amount that would have been payable had the Employee actually taken the leave which is cashed out.

31.9 If an Employee's employment ceases, they will be paid any accrued annual leave.
31.10 The Company is entitled to consider the operational requirements of the workplace when authorising leave and the Employee must advise their Supervisor of the dates to facilitate adjustments to Employee's rostering with the ambition of avoiding additional travel costs and ensuring adequate cover of work rosters.
31.11 For the purposes of annual leave under the NES, a shift worker means:
    a) an Employee engaged to work in a system of consecutive shifts throughout the 24 hours of each of at least six (6) consecutive days without interruption (except during breakdown or meal breaks or due to unavoidable causes beyond the control of the Company) and who is regularly rostered to work those shifts;
