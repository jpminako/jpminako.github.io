      Travel
      Policy
      The travel policy provides the guidelines to support the most effective journey management plans.
      Travel Components

      Accommodation
      Where an employee is required to stay overnight away from their point of hire (i.e. no connecting flight, training or they are required in an office away from their point of hire) the company will arrange & pay for suitable accommodation. The company reserves the right to select appropriate accommodation based on the specific requirements.

      Meal Allowance
      Where an employee is required to stay overnight away from their point of hire or site, the Company will reimburse meal expenses up to a value of $35 per night spent away subject to the provision of relevant receipts and excluding any alcohol consumption.

      Transport
      To/From Airport

      Suitable transportation will be arranged by the company between the project airport and the camp/site. For site based employees, transport from home airport to residence (e.g. taxi’s and fees incurred for vehicle parking) is to be arranged by, and at the cost of, the employee.

      Where possible a vehicle will be provided to non-site based employees. Where this is not possible the employee will be able to claim reimbursement for km’s travelled in their personal vehicle as per the Motor Vehicle Policy. The company will reimburse the employee for parking fees, or where more cost effective the General Manager may authorise the use of a return taxi service.

      To/From Function

      It is the responsibility of the employee to arrange transport to/from an authorised business function or social event unless the Managing Director approves the use of a taxi service.

      For Overnight Stay

      Where an employee is required to stay away from their point of hire at the request/direction of the company, the company will arrange & pay for the necessary transportation (e.g. taxi, car hire, fuel and parking fees). An example of this is where an employee is required to stay overnight in a capital city because they have missed a connecting flight to return to their point of hire for circumstances beyond their control.

      H-HRM-POL-029              REV DATE: 18-10-2021





      Flights To & From Site
      The most effective and commercially sound journey management plan shall always be adopted. This will generally mean that flights to site will largely be the first morning flight and flights from site will largely be last afternoon or evening flight. Project Managers have the authority to approve alternative arrangements in specific circumstances where due to safety concerns (i.e. client or Company fatigue management plans require otherwise) or commercial reasons (i.e. unreasonably high connecting flight costs) it becomes more effective for the Company to arrange an earlier flight out from site or a later flight to site. In these individual cases the Project Manager should seek guidance from their Manager prior to authorising.

      Journey management plans shall be regularly reviewed to ensure they continue to be the most effective and commercially sound.

      Employee Late Flight Cancellation and Missed Flights
      Employees must inform site as soon as practical upon becoming aware that they need to cancel (or have missed) their flight.

      The Discipline and Termination Management Procedure will apply. Typically, unjustified missed flights and late cancellations will result into a formal written warning. Further unjustified missed flights and late cancellations may result in dismissal.

      Employees who miss their flights will be charged applicable fare costs. Where an employee believes there are extenuating circumstances for missing the flight, the Company will assess each case on its merits.

      Where a client introduces a site policy regulating flight cancellations and no shows, its terms will be adopted in conjunction with this policy and will prevail should the terms be conflicting. Appropriate communication will be carried out to ensure all relevant employees understand the specific terms.



      H-HRM-POL-029              REV DATE: 18-10-2021


      Leave
      Policy
      We are committed to managing leave in accordance with all legislative requirements. This policy describes the most frequent leave types and is administered in accordance with the leave support procedure.
      Types of Leave

      All types of leave must be approved by the appropriate General Manager.



      Annual Leave
      Annual Leave accrues progressively during a year of service to 20 days (pro-rata) per year according to the ordinary hours of work, accumulating from year to year. Any annual leave in excess of 4 weeks can be paid out at the request of the employee.

      Annual leave shall be taken Monday to Friday only, excluding public holidays. It cannot be taken in advance unless it is unpaid. FIFO employees shall plan their leave in alignment with roster requirements, ensuring leave is taken at the beginning or end of each cycle in order to minimise operational impact and flight costs. An annual leave request may be refused if it poses significant hindrance on operational requirements.

      In order to meet operational requirements the Company may require an employee to take a period of annual leave during shut down periods (e.g. Christmas), or in such cases where the employee is deemed to have accrued an excessive amount of leave.



      Personal/Carer’s Leave
      An employee may take paid personal/carer’s leave:

      ·        If they are unfit for work because of their own personal illness or injury; or

      ·        To provide care or support to a member of their immediate family or household, because of a personal illness, injury or unexpected emergency affecting the member.

      This type of leave accrues progressively through the year of service to 10 days (pro-rata) per year. It is paid at base salary, plus any applicable allowances based on ordinary hours of work.

      The employee shall inform their manager as soon as practical of their absence and must advise of their expected period of absence based on their circumstances. The employee shall provide their manager with evidence that their absence meets the criteria for this type of leave (ie. a Medical Certificate or Statutory Declaration).

      ·        Worked at least 330 hours in the ten month period (an average of 1 day/wk)

      ·        Adjusted taxable income of $150,000 or less in the financial period prior to the birth

      ·        Is a Permanent Australian Resident

      Unpaid Parental Leave
      An employee is eligible to unpaid parental leave for a period of up to 12 months, provided they have completed at least 12 months of continuous service with within the group. This may be extended upon a written request at least 4 weeks prior to their scheduled return date, for up to 24 months in total for an individual, or 24 months as a combined total between an employee couple.

      Following a period of unpaid parental leave an employee is guaranteed the prospect to return to work in either their previous position or if that position no longer exists, an available position for which they are qualified and suited.



      Long Service Leave
      Long Service Leave accrues progressively to 8⅔ weeks for 10 years of continuous service and will be paid at base salary. Although Long Service Leave cannot be taken earlier it will be paid pro-rata to an employee who terminates after 7 years of continuous service.



      Community Service Leave
      Community service leave is for the purpose of performing activities such as a ‘voluntary emergency management activity’ or jury service (including attendance for jury selection). Community service leave is unpaid, with the exception of leave for the purpose of jury service. In this instance the employee will receive jury service pay for the first 10 days of service and the company will provide any additional payments to ensure the employee receives their ordinary base salary. Where the company requests evidence of the community service conducted, payment may be withheld until this is provided.

      H-HRM-POL-030     REV DATE: 18-10-2021


      Roster
      Policy
      The company often operates in geographically dispersed and remote areas on a fly-in/fly-out basis with a number of different rosters. Rosters are managed in accordance with the principles below and administered with the terms and conditions described in the rosters management procedure.
      ·        Rosters are established at the discretion of the Company

      ·        Rosters vary from project to project

      ·        Rest and Recreation (R&R) is applicable only to those employees that work on a regular Fly-In/Fly-Out roster

      ·        R&R is accrued pro-rata for the time physically spent on site based on the applicable roster. For example, on a 3 & 1 roster employees will accrue .33 days R&R for each day spent on site. On a 15 & 6 roster employees will accrue .4 days R&R for each day spent on site

      ·        R&R is only accrued whilst physically on site, including sick days

      ·        R&R eligibility is rounded to the closest full day over the applicable rotation

      ·        Accrued R&R must be fully exhausted before any leave is authorised. For example:

      o   Where an employee is away from site for the last 5 days of the cycle on a 15 & 6 roster then they shall use the accrued R&R for the 10 days spent on site (4 days in this example) plus any previously accrued R&R before they can take annual leave. Then they shall commence the 6 days R&R as per their roster

      o   If an employee on a 3 & 1 roster wants to return 3 days late from R&R, they shall take any accrued R&R prior to any annual leave being accessed for those three days

      o   If an employee has returned 5 days late to site on a 15/6 roster, they will only accrue 4 days R&R for that rotation. However they will be required to take 6 days R&R to align with site rosters. Where the employee does not have any previously accrued R&R, they will be required to take 2 days annual leave to meet operational requirements. Where the employee has no annual leave left, they shall take unpaid annual leave

      o   R&R is not portable from project to project. In exceptional circumstances, R&R might be portable to meet a critical operational requirement. In these circumstances accrued R&R will be costed to the receiving site and must be approved by the receiving GM

      o   R&R is paid at the base rate of pay plus applicable site allowance.
